    "transcript": "# Too Strong! || Abdusattorov vs Carlsen || Freestyle Chess Grand Slam Weissenhaus (2025) #\nhello everyone and welcome to a another game from round well basically round two of the quarterfinal match notbe Abus satro versus Magnus Carlson of the freestyle chess Grand Slam vion house Notre Beck lost the first game and unlike gues he has the white pieces now in game two so it will be a little bit easier maybe for him to play uh but it's uh yeah it's very interesting Magnus gave an interview regarding freestyle chess or chess n60 official random how uh you know it gives you an opportunity to dive straight into the middle game starting from move one so you don't have to worry about openings no preparations no you know um one of the reasons for example kaspar will still play uh you know a chess 960 tournament but he will not play regular chess because even though he can still play at a very very high level H he can no longer compete without opening Theory you know he just um he did play that one tournament like a couple of years ago and then you know he played the nidorf and everyone just obliterated him because you know there's new nidorf knowledge that he does not possess but if it's uh you know if pieces are scrambled anything goes and that's why uh these strong players like you know Fisher in his old age of 29 and you know Kasparov and and Magnus prefer this style uh to to regular chess because you can enjoy you know chess without constantly have to constantly having to improve on chess Theory and you can't really compete I mean when you're over 30 you cannot compete with someone who's like 15 you know they can study 15 hours a day and soak up everything you will not be able to compete with that theory wise but you can you know compete uh when it comes to creativity or or you know end game skill or you know just general middle game game stuff so that's why I believe in top level chests um especially with these older guys like Magnus and and and you know everyone else um it's it is favorable plus also you know you don't have to prepare for a big classical event for like I don't know like for Tata steel I imagine Magnus would have to prepare for at least a week or maybe two weeks you know to prepare some some crazy opening Theory uh to to employ there but yeah okay uh I wanted to mention that a little bit but yeah not has to win if he wins against Magnus he goes into tie breaks if not it is Magnus going into the semi-finals of this very nice event so let's see what happened here uh Knight to B3 I like uh like Fabby played against gukesh but here Magnus does not reply in kind he plays Pawn to F6 so okay the idea is Pawn to E5 grabbing the center and that is exactly what notb goes for Pawn to E4 Pawn to E5 and pawn to F3 we have Knight to sorry Knight to C6 uh Pawn to C4 and Knight to B6 so M Magnus maybe even signaling a nice Queens side castles here but it all depends on what notbe plays we have D3 Knight to A4 uh and pawn to D4 we have e captur on D4 Knight captures uh and queen to E5 putting pressure on the Knight and already we have some very interesting uh stuff here Knight to C2 A5 uh Queen to D2 and now Pawn to F5 where Notre Beck does not capture even though it's perfectly fine he plays Pawn to F4 he gives up a pawn uh to go for some active development and try and pressure magnus's King so Queen captures we have Bishop to D3 Queen to E6 and now Knight D to E3 getting the Knight into the game and the Knight obviously coming to D5 uh will be uh very very strong there uh so what can Magnus do Magnus could defend his Pawn with Pawn to G6 but he does not he gives the pawn back H brings the Knight into the game he has different plans for this game Bishop captures on F5 attacks the queen we have Queen to F6 and now not plays Bishop to F2 it was much better to go for some like a castle Queen side here but with Bishop to F2 he runs into a most unfavorable move uh and that is I'm not going to tell you what it is what do you think it is if you haven't seen the game like it it's really a powerful move what what did Magnus play here so here Magnus uh played the bishop to E6 and it seems like a move that doesn't do all that much like okay it attacks the bishop but we can either move the bishop or defend the bishop or capture this bishop so why why is this such a big deal well it's a big deal because if you capture on E6 Magnus will not recapture with the queen Magnus will recapture with the pawn and you might be thinking okay well we defend F4 now and what's the big deal here well the big deal deal here is that you're playing uh uh this uh fishal random chest not regular chest and in regular chest when you have to White Queen on the D file your brain is not even considering the possibility that your opponent will Castle Queen side but here that's exactly what would happen and here you resign there's no move you can play uh the queen has to move you're going to give a nice check the King has to go under the mask of the rook and once you move the king captures attacks the queen also comes with check and this is a resignation so after Bishop to E6 Notre cannot trade he has to go back he plays Bishop to D3 and now Magnus just picks up the pawn queen captures on F4 and he maintains this very very strong position uh being up a pawn okay notb goes Bishop to G3 he might uh you know get something out of this I mean it's it's a very strong bishop and Magnus could go say queen G5 he could trade on D3 with check then going Queen G5 he instead goes Queen to F7 puts pressure on this long diagonal here H and not backck castles Queen side and now Magnus also castled Queen side but I believe this is only due to the fact that Magnus already won game one and now he only needs a draw to win the match had Magnus um uh you know tried playing this for the win he would probably find Pawn to B5 and if you see Pawn to B5 and look at this look at this look at the Knights look at The Rook this is is uh this is overwhelming you might be thinking so what's the problem I mean we can capture on B5 yes you can but then Bishop captures on A2 and you might even capture the Knight here but then Knight B3 Checkmate so it's only one of the cool lines but uh uh B5 here as a reply to not's Castle's Queen side is extremely powerful it is the top move recommended by the engine I'm just you know uh throwing it out there for you guys to enjoy but okay Magnus only needs a draw he castles Queen side and now Rook H to F1 we have Knight captur on D3 Magnus trades down a little bit and he offers a queen trade as he only needs a draw to uh to win this match we have captur captur and now Knight to D5 uh D6 and now Rook D to E1 going after the bishop and now Magnus just plays Knight E5 goes after the C4 Pawn says all right I have a uh I either have a beautiful Knight on E5 or you capture and then we just trade everything and at the end of this line I also captured the pawn on H2 and we're going to play an end game where I'm up a pawn and I'm very happy with a draw because that means I win the match uh but on the on the other hand there's nothing better for Notre here so he did trade everything Magnus threw in this bishop captures and D5 first C captures Pawn captures Rook captures on E5 and Rook captures on H2 and now okay uh two Rooks still in the game Bishop versus knight Magnus up a pawn it's a double G Pawn but yeah Magnus only needs a draw uh Knight E3 and Bishop to C5 Magnus would not mind even trading uh the the bishop for Knight here we have Rook to F7 uh and Rook to H5 offering a trade of Rooks as well we have Rook to E6 and now uh Bishop captures with check Rook captures and Rook captur on D5 Rook captur on G7 and now Rook to C5 with check we have Rook to C3 uh otherwise um you would get checkmated so Rook captures B captures and now Rook to D6 def on G6 and uh Notre backck would probably just uh you know uh either resign here well you would not resign here because you can very well fight this to a draw but notb needs the win so he has to start playing risky and he's down a p in The Rook end game against Magnus this is uh if there was a a tougher position where you would have to win against Magnus I don't know what what what would it be unless it was you know a straight out losing position so okay Pawn to A4 Magnus goes Rook C6 goes after the Pawn King to C2 we have Rook to C4 going after the pawn and Rook to G8 with check we have a couple of repetitions here King G7 King to d8 and now he has to go for the trade otherwise uh he can just uh you know leave the tournament we have Pawn to G4 Notre does get his pass Pawn but so does Magnus King King to D7 we have King to D3 Rook to F4 and now King to E3 okay another repetition Rook C4 King D3 and now I thought Magnus would repeat because he's satisfied with a draw but no now he wants to win he plays Pawn to B5 uh we have Rook to A6 and pawn to A4 we have Pawn to G5 yes you can push the pawn but um uh once The Rook comes behind the pawn there's really no advancing that pawn to Victory uh Pawn to C6 cutting off The Rook here we have G6 King to D6 and now King to pawn to G7 Rook to G4 not waiting for Rook to A8 of course and now Rook to A7 the pawn has to be defended King to C5 we have Rook to F7 and now Rook to G3 with check King C2 we have another repetition here King D3 but Magnus pushes for the win A3 uh Rook to A7 and now Rook to G3 with check King to C2 King C4 and Rook captures on A3 there's no other way to do it Rook captures on G7 and Rook to A6 Magnus goes Rook to G2 with check King to C1 and King captures and C3 Rook captures and C6 and there's only one move that wins here for Magnus but of course he finds it no doubt you guys see it as well it is Rook King to B3 and he was in this position on move 55 that Notre backck abdat resigned the game as there is nothing more to be done here so yeah you can see uh maybe only glimpses maybe you can see the full picture of what Magnus had in mind when he said that you go straight into the middle game and uh you know you just you just play chess you just brawl it out there's no uh no uh swimming in the protected Waters of theory there's nothing to you know nothing to to keep you safe you you just go out there and you can you can lose and move one you can lose on move two you you can literally lose on move one if you play a silly move and um yeah it's just a very very uh different chess and although there's not so much to analyze you know openings wise uh at least for now uh it is uh you know it is pretty pretty crazy uh but yeah here you resign we can even show a nice win here for example you will advance the pawn to B4 and now you just uh push the pawn you kick away the white king and that's pretty much it you kick away the white king something like this and uh at some point you will push B3 you will kick away the king and uh White will give a check and now you will uh sort of create a bridge for your king to cross on the C file and now if white wants to continue checking for example via the back rank you will now go Rook to A8 and after let's say Rook to H1 check King to A2 you can pin it but now King to A1 and that's it this is one of the positions for example where white would have to resign or you go Rook H1 the queen comes into the game captures captures and then the rook and king will Checkmate the the white king so some of you might appreciate that uh but yeah that's the game hope you guys enjoyed it very nice Victory by Magnus he kicks not backck out of the competition proceeds into the semifinals where he will face the winner of the match ala versus Vincent I'm not going to disclose who won as I probably will cover that as as well and uh we already know that Fabby eliminated gues and he will face the winner of the match hikaro versus javal sarov uh that two of the classical games ended in a draw and then well I'm not going to spoil anything but uh someone won and of course Fabby will meet uh uh the winner of that uh match uh but yeah we I will cover one more game and then I will disclose who is who is playing who so hope you guys enjoyed it very nicely done by Magnus as usual showing CL in every step of the game you know except in the openings as there aren aren't any here but yeah you know what I mean I would like to thank Andreas rosental Andre sh David bacon Andrew steinel and Yuri ralchenko for your contribution to my channel thank you a lot I really appreciate it as usual you can check two of my previous videos here thank you for watching and I will see you soon continuing to check up on your wonderful suggestions and whatever else happens in the Chess World uh thank you all I will see you

            "comment": "freestyle chess stifles opening prep and hence players don't have the ability to easily reach sterile drawish positions. This was Carlsen's complaint about standard chess, which forced him to take huge risks in order to try and win games. This beared fruit today where all games were essentially decisive (the one that ended in a draw should've been decisive as well). As mentioned previously, it's not a perfect game as perhaps white has a greater advantage compared to standard chess, but in this round, black did very well!\n\nIf you look at old tournaments of standard chess, you'll find that the number of decisive games are quite high as well - showing that when opening prep is limited, it's actually not that simple to just play for a draw.\n\nAnd just imagined if computers didn't exist - how difficult would it be to understand the games! It would've been such a great experience.",
