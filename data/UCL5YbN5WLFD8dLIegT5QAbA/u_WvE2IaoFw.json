    "transcript": "# Checkmate or The Queen? || Carlsen vs Sindarov || Freestyle Chess Grand Slam Weissenhaus (2025) #\nhello everyone and welcome back to everyone's favorite chess variant the official random variant of course it is Magnus Carlson versus jaok Cinder of and it is round five of the freestyle chess Grand Slam vion house uh Magnus not doing all that great he won two games and lost two games but um jaok is doing incredibly well and if he can do well against Magnus here with the black pieces he could be leading the tournament after day one but we're going to talk about that in a little bit uh first let's see what happened here uh it's a really really wonderful game Magnus has the white pieces and he opens with Pawn to F3 which would be very very weird if this was a normal chess game but it's not so it's not weird at all and here jaer already doing some um Mind Games he plays Pawn to F5 he says if F3 is good F5 must be better and okay there's a rook behind the pawn so obviously uh it makes sense uh we have Pawn to D4 and pawn to D6 Magnus goes Knight to D 3 and Knight to F6 we have Knight to G3 and Knight to G6 uh Pawn to A4 and pawn to A5 so both players just making moves that uh you know from experience you know that um should be should be good we have Pawn to E4 striking in the center if Magnus um is not having issues with executing Pawn to E4 then he should already be better if there is something then you know could be problematic so let's see what happens F captures we have F captures uh and and Bishop to A7 grabbing hold of this long diagonal which also makes sense is there's a queen on G1 and now Pawn to H3 uh taking away the G4 Square from jav's pieces uh we have Pawn to E5 striking in the center and Bishop to E3 now countering the strong dark Square Bishop on A7 e captur on e4 Bishop captur we have bishop captur and the Magnus centralizes the queen with Queen captur on D4 uh Bishop to E6 we have Castle's King side uh for those of you who are maybe watching chess 960 for the for the first time uh the way you Castle is that you have to clear everything in between the king and Rook that you know would usually uh stop you from castling in normal chest and then you just put the king to the square where the king would go in normal chess and you put the Rook to a square where the Rook would go to a normal chest so if you started with a king on E1 and The Rook on H1 you would castle and the king would be on G1 and Rook on F1 uh every day you know every year cover like one uh official random tournament and then I like to explain those rules at least in one video so okay uh Knight back to D7 uh of course you would also want to play let's say queen F7 and Castle's King side the problem is that pawn to E5 and uh you blunder the game so this game over so after Castle's King side we have Knight to D7 now grabbing control of E5 and C5 and also offering a trade of Rooks we have Knight to F5 for the moment Magnus stops that and Knight G to E5 we have Knight to F4 and Bishop to C4 putting pressure on magnus's Rook on F1 Rook to F2 getting out of the way and pawn to G6 chasing away the Knight Knight back to E3 attacks the bishop and now Pawn to G5 so what uh what can you do here we have Knight F to D5 uh Rook captures on F2 we have King captures on F2 and now Bishop captures on D5 e captures on D5 and Knight to C5 and this is the position after 19 moves were played uh it's a you know pretty pretty nice position both kings are in the center of the board magnus's King looking a little B weird on on F2 uh jav's Knights are excellently placed here you can't really challenge them B4 is impossible so what can Magnus do uh not a lot actually you you would want to free up the light Square Bishop somehow it's not really going to do anything on A2 and if you play C3 already you blunder the game a nice Fork here and you can resign so Magnus plays Rook to A3 hoping to somehow get the Rook into the game and maybe get that Bishop into the game H but we have Queen to G6 now again stopping the advancement of the C pawn and queen to D1 now C3 and C4 are definitely uh sort of a threat and jaok has to be uh ready for that and you could uh see also maybe Castle's Queen side here but he goes for Queen to E4 he's not worried about the bishop on B1 and he says he's going in for the kill he wants to play Pawn to G4 maybe even Pawn to H5 Pawn to G4 uh what can Magnus do here uh Magnus plays Pawn to C4 first he goes after the queen queen to F4 check we have King to G1 and now well you could maybe play some other moves uh Castle's Queen side The Rook will definitely come in handy uh with the attack on the white king and Magnus again he could play some natural moves here but he goes for Bishop captures on H7 he says yeah it's not a problem I'm just going to grab a pawn I mean what what could possibly happen uh we have King to B8 uh very useful move because if you you know if Rook h8 then Bishop to F5 might come with check and it might give white a very valuable Tempo so of course javir wants to deny Magnus that Tempo and here Magnus played Rook to C3 it's not easy to figure out what to play here but Rook to C3 just isn't it it's a position where there really aren't uh any good moves for Magnus one uh resource will find would be Pawn to G3 it looks like a disgusting move to play because what what's stopping you from Queen captur on G3 and then it's check and then your king side is ruined but uh you know that's why chess is um such a wonderful game if you actually did this and after Knight G2 exposing the Queen the queen has no squares the Knight covers these two squares the pawn covers this square and the queen is trapped well it would be trapped if you couldn't give up some material to you know free up some squares so you could give up a knight let's say to fre up D5 square and then after Bishop captures on D3 you could also capture on H3 and then uh the you know the the position as not The Rook is not attacking H3 the black queen can get back into the game but at the price of a piece and already you're back in the game let's say Bishop E2 you attack the Queen the queen escapes Queen H7 and now we play but it's a really really tricky move to find Magnus on the other hand plays Rook to C3 invest some 20 seconds finding this but now comes uh a move so silent and deadly uh but also brilliant and that is really to E8 look at this move it it it seems that it does nothing but it it it does everything there's no no good move for Magnus to to make here he brings the bishop back to C2 but now comes Knight E to D3 uh blocking The Rook from defending the Knight on E3 and what can you do you can you can play Rook captus and sort of grab the two knights um with the queen but then there's Rook capes on E3 and you're just down the exchange in a much much um worse position so the this is losing so after Knight E to D3 Magnus has to go for Bishop captures on D3 there's no other way to continue the game now comes Queen captures on E3 with check as The Rook is blocked King to H2 and now it is important to bring the king back to H1 we have Queen to F4 check King to H1 and now Queen to F2 Joker threatens Rook to E1 check to win magnus's Queen and it seems like there's nothing you can do here but there is one move there is Rook to C1 however that FS the Pawn to G4 how do you how do you prevent this well Queen to F1 uh let's trade Queens but there's the intermediate Knight captures on D3 or rather the fishion Su Knight captures on D3 Queen captures on D3 you have to take back your piece and now G captures and queen captures and it seems that Magnus got out of this mess even being up a pawn but um of course that's why we love CH that's why we play CH that could not be further from the truth feel free to pause the video and win the game for javir while I give you a couple of seconds so uh for those of you who were able to do it congratulations on finding this beautiful maneuver and for those of you who just want to enjoy the show it is Queen to D4 this is what Joker played and he was in this position on move 33 that Magnus Carlson resigned to the game as there is nothing more to be done here Rook the h8 is coming and that's it you either give up the queen or you move the queen and then it's Checkmate as the king cannot go to G1 so you can maybe free up the king but then you lose the queen or you move the queen and then you get checkmated now of course some of you are probably thinking well I thought of Queen captures on B2 because it's also the same well yes it is but you know when you can choose between two moves that are equally uh equally good and both of them accomplish the same thing if you can do so without taking material it is considered to be the more gentlemanly thing to do and that is um you know also why we play chess we're not some barbar Varian you know going around and hitting stuff we like to find the most elegant Solutions and I believe Queen to D4 is much more elegant than Queen captures on B2 it's always nicer if you win by capturing less material at least that is my opinion I don't know if you guys agree with that uh but yeah that's the game hope you guys enjoyed it very nicely di by Joker taking down Magnus Carlson with the black pieces with with excellent play I mean there's no other way to put it and five rounds have been played so for those of you who are maybe not interested in results I will now show the stand in after five rounds have been played these are the standings so Fabiano Carana and Joker leading with 4 and a half points um both of them have defeated Magnus so that goes you know nicely along along the lead ala with three and a half points also doing well Notre abat two and a half points then Magnus gukesh and Hikaru and Vincent on two points and Vladimir fer and Leon Aran so far on one point and that means that tomorrow we have four more rounds of this and uh then the top eight are going into the uh the the final stage where they will be playing classical chess and then uh I believe we will have uh better quality games and you know people will not just be blundering stuff or or pieces or or or or checkmates in in in a single move uh but we will get to enjoy some quality chess but yeah until then we're going to have some fun and you know we'll see who who who else can blunder blunder something uh so yeah I hope you guys enjoyed that like I said very nice little done by Joker not a lot of people can take down Magnus with black even though here I have no idea if it's even you know at disadvantage to play Black because you have no idea what you are doing and white um you know white has the first opportunity to mess up the position so I don't know if it's advantages to play White here or not but yeah hope you enjoyed it I would like to thank Ronnie lav Andreas rosental Andre shade David bacon and Andrew steinel for a contribution to my channel thank you a lot I really appreciate it as usual you can check two of my previous videos here thank you for watching Ing and I will see you soon uh continuing to check up on your wonderful suggestions but also covering this very nice event uh until it finishes uh thank you all I will see you soon and have an excellent rest of your day",

It has a lot more starting weaknesses and white usually can develop a big initiative with a narrow path for black to stay in the game objectively. I think normal chess is one of the most balanced starting positions from what I\u2019ve seen. Obviously anyone could be outplayed, but most 10-20 move games go the way of white in Freestyle.",
