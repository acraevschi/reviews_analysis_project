    "transcript": "# Too Strong For Weak Moves! || Caruana vs Gukesh || Freestyle Chess Grand Slam Weissenhaus (2025) #\nhello everyone and welcome to the second day of the quarterfinals of the freestyle chess Grand Slam vion house it is Fabiano Carana versus gukesh and in the previous game I don't know if you've seen it it was a it was a beautiful game by both of them but at a critical point in the game gukesh had to decide between two very very difficult lines one involved sacrificing his queen and the other one well in involved not sacrificing the queen but also was very promising uh gukesh went for the lad line and um it just wasn't enough to take down fa Indian GES even lost so now gkes has to win with black otherwise he is eliminated and Fabby goes into the semi-finals of this fine event and it's a pretty cool uh position and it's a pretty cool game a very very short one I think the shortest one that we've had so far uh even you know not so much in terms of moves even though it's very short it's 18 moves long but um uh I don't know you'll just see it's very hard to explain but the position is interesting like uh if you just for example they started with Knight B three Knight to B6 but already if you wanted you could uh bring the other Knights into the game and just Castle here so castles castles you would get some sort of a crazy position where the knights are out and the Bishops are nicely tucked in The Rook uh is where the Rook is supposed to be the other Rook as well and the queen almost basically on a starting Square so it's uh not something that uh would would confuse the players I would say as much as maybe some other positions uh but okay we have Pawn to E4 uh even in chess 960 one has to control control the center to win the game we have E5 Pawn to F3 and Knight to C6 we have Pawn to D4 e captures and Knight captures on D4 we have Pawn to F5 H it's a very interesting Pawn Sacrifice by GES it's hard to say if uh they figured it out before the actual game as they can discuss the positions a little bit or maybe gkes spoted it during the game but this F5 move took gues some almost 10 minutes on the clock and uh it's a very strong it's the top move recommended by the engine saying that uh okay yes you are giving up this Pawn but you are going after this pawn and gha's plan is very very sound but after Fabby played Knight captures on F5 gkes should have captured on A2 right away you capture it and after The Rook attacks Bishop you move uh away you play Bishop to E6 and you go after the Knight that is the best way to uh to continue this game but gkes first play G6 sort of comes with Tempo because uh well not just will you capture on A2 but you will also make maybe get to play Bishop to G7 which looks very nice but the problem is after Knight to D4 now you're kind of not in time to capture on A2 still captures Bishop captures on A2 but now Fabby throws in a knight captures and C6 uh C6 attacking The Rook on B8 as well and weakening the A7 Pawn uh so okay he did not play it right away he first played Rook to A1 but you can play it either way you can first capture on C6 and then Rook A1 or rook and one and A1 and then capture Bishop back to D6 and now he captures on C6 D captures and Rook captures on A7 uh we have Queen to E7 and already Queen to A5 so you can see that it's much much different and also uh it cost gues a pawn in the in the process while not getting all that much as you would get if if you didn't go for this G6 plan but okay Bishop H6 check we have Bishop to E3 blocking Bishop captures on E3 Knight captures on E3 and now castles King side it's a pretty long Castle but uh well if you don't forget that it's possible you know it's uh it's it's just there uh we have Queen back to C3 and now believe it or not there is very little that um that gukesh can do after this queen to C3 move uh well bkash played Rook to A8 he wants to trade off Rooks which makes sense he wants to activate his own Rooks and this Rook isn't very active here so Faby played captures we have captures and now Pawn to B3 Kesh can now go Queen to A3 with check or he can try some other plan but uh for example deliver delivering this check looks very strong but after Bishop D3 there's just no good way to uh handle it and you you you you'll just bring the Rook into the game Hide Your King over to the king side and you'll just enjoy extra pawn and a much safer King so gkes has to try something he plays Queen G5 goes after the king here uh and now Bishop to E2 just nicely developing preparing to to bring the Rook into the game Pawn to C5 going after fabi's Queen side but fabibi doesn't care now he's the one castling King's side we have Rook to d8 and here we have Pawn to F4 uh Pawn to F4 wasn't I believe even played uh let me let me just check real quickly uh it actually ended on castles yeah on castles it ended here gues saw the position and he was in this position on move 18 that gues do maraju resigned the game and with it is out of the competition Fabby proceeds into the semi-finals where he will face well whoever whoever wins some of the other games all of three are still being played and uh it's interesting here that there's no plan that um guesh can sort of come up with that will stop Pawn to F4 uh or or you know you're just going to allow the The Rook to claim the D5 for example you you you block The Rook on the D file simply advancing the pawn to F4 already wins the game like Queen goes to E7 f five there's I mean if you don't want to ruin your Pawn structure you have to go back F6 is coming and now you either you know allow instant game over like this or you maybe play Queen to F7 and then you give up the C5 Pawn now you're down two pawns and then this Pawn is coming to E5 and you will just you know commit yourself to some very very slow suffering and on the other hand after Castle's King side you could try to stop it with Rook to f8 this does prevent Pawn to F4 but then you give up the D file and yes the game continues by I think Lukes was just um so disgusted with his position that he decided to call the day wasn't his match wasn't his game uh he he he didn't want to you know uh even try maybe of course it is always possible that Fabby messes something up uh you know on a grand scale it would have to really be on a grand scale to mess this up but gues says Nope I resign and that's it fabbi is the winner and he is the one going to the semi-finals I could check up on some other games but I will also probably be making a second video on some of the games that finish so I will keep you guys informed on the on the results but yeah not not the greatest result for the reigning world classical Champion uh we'll see we'll see what's what's next for him and what great victories will he achieve uh in perhaps the next tournament so yeah I hope you guys enjoyed it brilliant stuff by Fabby I mean we are used to Fabby you know brilliantly dominating games like this so nothing nothing spectacular here I would like to thank Andreas Ros Andre sh David bacon Andrew steinel and Yuri renko for your contribution to my channel thank you a lot I really appreciate it as usual you can check to my previous videos here thank you all for watching and I will see you soon continuing to check up on your wonderful suggestions and whatever else happens in the Chess World thank you all I will see you soon and have an excellent rest of your day",
