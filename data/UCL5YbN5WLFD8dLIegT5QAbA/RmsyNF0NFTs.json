    "transcript": "# A Masterclass! || Keymer vs Carlsen || Freestyle Chess Grand Slam Weissenhaus (2025) #\nhello everyone and welcome to the first game we'll be covering from the semi-finals of the freestyle chess Grand Slam vion house it is Vincent kimer versus Magnus Carlson and the two of them have met in some pretty prestigious competitions and it always seems that Magnus wins and yeah well you know it also makes sense he is arguably the best chess player whoever lived alongside some other very uh notable gentleman but you know Vincent is always there and he's always this close to to beating Magnus now is as good good a chance as any he does have the white pieces it's a classical game plenty of time to uh you know make it make it count and uh yeah let's let's see what happened in this one so Magnus uh or rather Vincent with white opens with Pawn to G4 not uh you know something that you will hear very often with someone having White against Magnus but in freestyle or in ch 960 or official random uh you know it it is more common than and the position is a pretty pretty weird one nothing uh nothing really odd about it the knight's placed in the corner so what I like to do when you have a chess 960 position is that um uh you always imagine the knights out of the cage so if the knights are out of the cage basically this is what you look at what is this can we can we somehow make this work into a normal position and particularly for this one if you look at the position of the king and Rook uh you can Castle immediately so if it's wh's move and white wants to Castle you can just Castle because those were C1 and D1 are the squares where the king and Rook would be if you Castle Queens side in normal chest so if you want to do that you can then it's even you know more resembling a normal position so these are some of the things that I'm pretty sure players um take into consideration before making their first move and also if you guys would enjoy that I could also do some research on you know what goes into the preparation like what what what are the best things to look for when trying to decipher a CH 960 position so you know um uh watching it more and more I'm getting uh you know a sort of um I'm I'm creating a sort of a liking for it uh but okay let's continue with the analysis we have Pawn to G4 by Vincent and Magnus goes for Knight to G6 we have Knight to B3 uh Pawn to E5 and Knight to G3 of course uh the knights will come out we have Pawn to F6 free up the queen uh and pawn to C4 and already Magnus castles Queen side so castles and pawn to D4 and if you look at the situation on the clocks uh uh Vincent already burned 40 minutes of his time players start with an hour and a half Magnus has an hour Vincent has 50 minutes and we're only at move five so that is how much time players are burning in these first few moves because if you mess up here you know you're You're gone uh Knight to B6 Magnus also brings the other Knight into the game and it's probably the least punishing piece you can use to to to to play in in fishal random because the Knight can always go back if you if you know you you move a pawn to a silly Square you could very easily be already lost we have Pawn to D5 Pawn to D6 and Bishop to F5 with check okay Magnus nicely blocks offers a trade of Bishops we have Pawn to F3 and pawn to A6 we have Pawn to E4 Vincent creating a well a huge Center here and the Magnus goes Knight to F4 we have Bishop captures on D7 Knight sorry Rook captures on D7 and now Vincent plays sort of a trolling move he plays King to C2 but it's a lot trickier than it uh than it appears and that's also this move is one of the reason why I'm calling this video a master class uh because it's it's just very very deep now you could continue this a lot of different ways but if you Castle uh if you Castle right away then this Pawn uh can be captured and then the Rook is on D1 and if the pawn is already captured and the path towards the black king opens up you kind of want your King on B1 and The Rook on C1 so I guess Vincent figured this out and he played this maybe it's a bad move uh but uh you know in in Practical terms I I I I would say it's it's an ingenious move because now should Magnus Capt on C4 then you play King B1 and The Rook is already attacking the Knight and you cannot go back because of Queen captur on B6 and Magnus can resign so after King to C2 H Bishop to A7 by Magnus uh there there are also some other lines maybe that you can try but basically what you would have to do after Knight captures and King to B1 is go for this Knight to H3 move attack the queen because your knight is hanging and the Knight cannot go back and it would be a draw by rep repetition Queen G2 Knight F4 Queen has to go back otherwise if if you give up the E3 Square then the Knight can come to E3 for example if you go to H1 so Queen G1 Knight H3 Queen G2 and so on it will be a draw by rep repetition so maybe this was Vincent's offer at a draw uh Magnus not taking it regardless uh Bishop to A7 now preparing some nasty discoveries but Vincent not really interested in that he just continues development Bishop to D2 and now how do you take advantage of this there's really no good way to do it as the bishop is also well just hanging there on A7 so Magnus plays King to B8 now the bishop is defended and Bishop to E3 now if the Knight moves you can also capture with check so Knight to H3 attacks the queen we have Queen to G2 and now Knight to F4 uh we have Queen to F2 now now Vincent um uh very much looking forward to to playing this for a win and Magnus does not repeat he probably Vin would go Queen to E2 if Magnus repeated Knight to H3 so Magnus goes Pawn to H5 and now Rook Rook F to D1 we have H captures F captures and now okay you are maybe threatening to uh win a pawn here so just Knight to C8 by Magnus not allowing the bishop to go to F4 we have Pawn to C5 now blocking the the bishop on A7 and D captures on C5 we have Bishop captures on C5 Pawn to G6 limiting the movements of uh vincence Knight on G3 and Bishop captures on A7 we have Knight captures and King to B1 Vincent successfully artificially castles we have Queen to H7 and now Knight to C5 going after the Rook Rook D6 by Magnus uh will be useful as as a Defender but also Rook to B6 will be a very very nice move by Magnus uh Knight to E2 Vincent offers a trade of knights and Magnus obliges Knight captures Queen captures and now Knight to B5 Magnus activates uh the the lonely Knight on A7 we have Queen to C4 by Vincent and now Magnus goes Rook to C8 you could also maybe consider Rook to B6 it's a very tricky move and The Rook is very very well placed there it cannot be attack like if Knight A4 already Knight A3 wins the game the The Pawn is pinned then you're going to win the queen on C4 so you know it's a nice Square for The Rook but Magnus goes for Rook to C8 first H and now Pawn to A4 kicks away the Knight okay Magnus was basically just REM maneuvering that Knight to D4 it's a beautiful Square uh Pawn to G5 breaking down Magnus this Pawn chain and Rook C to d8 uh we have G captures on F6 Rook captures and Rook to F1 uh Vincent offers a trade of Rooks and Magnus goes to B6 now so Rook to B6 uh and Rook to F2 and serving as a defender of the B2 Pawn of the H2 Pawn also you can double up on the file if needed maybe a nice Rook lift to F7 so anything is possible we have Pawn to G5 by Magnus uh and the King to A2 uh Magnus also improves the position of his King we have King to A7 and now Vincent plays Rook C to F1 and it seems uh almost self-explanatory why the Rook is on uh the other Rook just came to F1 you want to play Rook to F7 or maybe it just seems that way because here Magnus played Pawn to G4 and I guess Vincent was worried about Queen captures on H2 but uh Rook to F7 you capture on C7 and this is a lost position for Magnus but Vincent with one minute on the clock uh goes Queen to C3 uh and okay Queen to C3 we have Knight to F3 by Magnus now stopping the Rooks also putting more pressure on that H2 Pawn Rook to G2 going after the G4 pawn and now Rook to G8 by Magnus Magnus now also getting very low on time Rook F to F2 doubling up on the second rank again excellent at defending and also you know for for attacking purposes and Magnus has to be very very careful not to put something on d f file like you put um or rather no he has to make sure not leave The Rook on G8 undefended for example or play something like here because then Rook captures uh and you can resign so here Rook to D6 by Magnus I imagine a waiting move or maybe he's trying to get that Rook into the game on the king side somehow I have no idea what Rook to D6 is uh but Vincent plays Queen to E3 and now Magnus uh well he doesn't want to see any nasty discoveries here goes King to A8 and now we have Knight to E6 and uh this is now a problem because Magnus although in a very very difficult position it's hard to even say what Magnus could play probably just move the King around let's say King B8 or Rook to D7 something you know waiting for Vincent what to do but Magnus played Pawn to C6 he actively challenged the Vincent's strong Center and now Magnus is completely lost however it is not an easy move to spot feel free to pause the video and figure it out while I give you a couple of seconds so for those of you who were able to do it congratulations on finding this incredible idea and for those of you who just want to enjoy the show it is Queen captures I'm only kidding it is Queen to A3 this is the move and uh the move C6 has weakened The Rook on D6 and there not only that I wish it was only that because uh it's uh if you don't really look for it you will not see it but the problem is uh how do you react we already said that the queen cannot really move if you if you try to defend the Rook with the queen then this Rook is saying you just capture on F3 and that's it g captures Rook captures with check King A7 Rook goes here attacks the Queen the queen will have to move further and then you will pick up this Rook as well and you're going to be up a knight and The Rook but of course Magnus would resign way before that even happened and the other problem is if you just move the Rook let's say Rook to D7 look at this knight f8 uh Forks the the the rook and the queen because the queen from A3 defends the Knight um on f8 so it's a very very unfortunate um uh Square for for The Rook if not defended by the C6 Pawn so there really isn't anything Magnus can do here and especially since he's very low on time below the one minute Mark he played Rook captures on E6 Vincent recaptured and now Magnus almost lost on time he played his next move with 1 second on the clock he played Rook to C8 and here Vincent started you know thinking about a position he already saw the move he was going to play he reached out for the Rook but Magnus quickly grabbed his hand mid The Rook pickup and congratulated him on his victory and he was in this position on move 39 that Magnus cson resigned the game as there is nothing more to be done here of course Vincent will just gobble up the G4 pawn and that's it uh there's there's no way for you to do anything here you're down the exchange the Knight is probably lost within a few moves there's the pass E6 Pawn to worry about uh there there's nothing like you if you try to save the Knight like we could just play a few was like Rook F7 I mean that is that is disgusting queen queen to h8 let's say queen B3 you threaten Checkmate if the Rook say defends against Checkmate the other Rook comes and okay now you can maybe play something like this but Rook C7 attacks the queen kicks away the queen and that's pretty much it you will start capturing on G7 and uh game over or maybe you know if you if you like um if you like funny stuff maybe in something like the queen moves you can go here and now if the if the queen goes back or anything like that you can even sacrifice the queen and then deliver a nice Checkmate here so even this is possible I know however you like it uh but yeah Vincent takes down Magnus in their first classical game with the white pieces but now we get to see we get to see Magnus in a must-win situation where he has the white pieces and uh well that can only be good for us the the the viewers uh so yeah that's the game hope you guys enjoyed it big big big congratulations to Vincent on this massive undertaking I would like to thank Andreas rosenal David bacon Andrew steinel Yuri ralchenko and Nathaniel Devin for your contribution to my channel thank you a lot I really appreciate it as usual you can check two of my previous videos here thank you for watching and I will see you soon continuing to check up on your wonderful suggestions but mostly covering this uh event until it finishes uh thank you all I will see you soon and have an excellent rest of your day",

No doubt GMs may learn to prefer this version of chess (960, Fischerrandom, whatever) 'cuz it saves them countless tedious hours memorizing or refreshing memory of openings.",
