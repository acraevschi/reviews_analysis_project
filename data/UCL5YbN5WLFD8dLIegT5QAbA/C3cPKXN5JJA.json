    "transcript": "# Not This Time! || Carlsen vs Keymer || Freestyle Chess Grand Slam Weissenhaus (2025) #\nhello everyone and welcome to an amazing game from day two of the freestyle chess Grand Slam vien house tournament it is Magnus Carlson versus Vincent kimer this is the semi-finals and uh Vincent won game one so now Magnus has to win on demand in order to force time breaks and the funny thing is Vincent was already in a similar situation in 2023 Fay World Cup where he defeated Magnus in the first game of the classical and then Magnus won on demand in game two and then uh well uh won the won the tiebreaker and that uh well I'm sure that's a very painful memory for Vincent and he would hate it if that was to repeat again however Magnus has the white pieces and he would love it if that was to happen again so let's see what happened here for those of you who haven't seen what happened uh well you you will have a great time now let's check it out Magnus with white uh opened with Pawn to F4 and okay it's a pretty crazy position the Bishops are on the king side the the heavy artillery is on on the queen side the King on C1 so you will have to clear at least Queen and Knight if you're are the castle Queen side and you will have to well clear pretty much everything if you're to Castle King side and um okay let's let's see what happens the idea is uh you're going to play F4 most likely G3 and that will open up your Bishop pair and probably Vincent will do the same so he plays Pawn to F5 mimicking Magnus uh Pawn to C3 this will come in very handy as it will limit the the the power of the dark Square Bishop on h8 Pawn to G6 and now Magnus strikes in the center with Pawn to D4 Vincent capitalizes on this by playing Pawn to C5 by playing both C4 and D4 Magnus created some very nice targets for Vincent this is now a Target and also the pawn on F4 is undefended and it will fall with check so Magnus defends the F for pawn and the Vincent takes this opportunity to trade down a little bit and uh of course I'm not saying that Vincent is playing for a draw but it always helps that a draw is enough for him to win the match so he is very much looking forward to uh trading down and creating a as simple a position as possible we have Bishop captures on D4 uh and now Pawn to E5 opening up the rook and further trading down we have F captures Bishop captures on E5 and queen to D3 H we have Knight to C6 putting more pressure on the bishop and now Bishop to C5 Magnus avoiding the trade we have Pawn to F4 H and now Knight to F2 you don't really have to react as um okay you are defending the G3 Square twice Queen to C7 now freeing up the queen you are now able to Castle Queen side if you so wish it and the g captures an F4 and instead of recapturing right away with check Vincent throws in a nice fishion sug uh Knight to E6 attacking the bishop and while Magnus could now trade Bishops um doesn't uh I mean it doesn't look like much Vincent's position is just brilliant here so after Knight E6 Magnus wants to keep the material on the board plays Knight to A3 and Vincent goes for Knight captures on F4 uh we have Queen back to C2 and now Knight to A5 with ideas of Knight coming to C4 it is nicely supported by the bishop and by the queen on C7 we have Knight to D2 and now Knight to D5 by Vincent and I think here we see first glimpses of Vincent maybe not playing for a win here castles Queens side King B8 and then maybe D5 uh doesn't look like a terrible way to to play for advantage or maybe just Pawn to D5 right away but Vincent goes Knight to D5 first also Knight to E3 looks like an excellent Square as the rookie will also help support that now Magnus goes Knight G4 attacks the bishop while defending the E3 Square Bishop back to G7 and now castles Queen side uh okay so what is Vincent to do he goes Knight back to B6 now opting for that C4 Square uh and pawn to B3 Magnus not allowing that we have Castle's Queen side and now Magnus uh rushes forward with Pawn to E4 uh he gives up the C3 Pawn but he will try to make something out of it Queen captures on C3 Queen captures we have Bishop captures on C3 and now Pawn to E5 and uh What uh I mean it's it's a pretty interesting situation probably uh well H5 H5 is what you should do here something like H5 Knight F6 and Rook to E6 and uh you claim that you have a very nice position but after Pawn to E5 uh Vincent played Pawn to D5 and this is such a crazy position where Magnus has now the opportunity to really take over the initiative but it's a move that I don't think anyone finds like as I like to say unless you have the soul of silicon you're not finding this one but in case you haven't seen the game you know have at it try to find a move that even Magnus could not find while I give you a couple of seconds so the moving question is King to C2 look at this and uh it's a it's a hard move to even uh consider especially with you know this being a neverbe seen position with little time on the clock uh the uh you know the well just being in the semi-finals of of such an event uh the problem is it's hard to find uh you know the theault behind Pawn to D4 it looks like such an amazing move the problem is it loses by force Knight F6 goes after The Rook okay you move the Rook nothing spectacular but then Bishop G2 happens and look at this bishop H3 and black will lose material so you're going to move the king king to B8 and now you play Bishop to D6 check and after the king moves you've uh well you've cornered The Rook now you play Bishop to H3 and there is no square for that Rook to go to as the two Bishops and the Knight cover everything so black will have to lose material here uh and that is uh that's not the best for black to play but you first you know you really ask yourself what what's wrong with D4 and only after you see that you will okay probably play as you cannot go here this is covered you will capture on D2 and after Rook captures well now you have the bishop fair in a in in a such a position where it's a completely open board and you have the past E Pawn that will I mean that will allow you to play for the win so this was a great opportunity for Magnus but he missed it but I mean who finds King to C2 I don't think so so Magnus played e cap on D6 alas saw and now Bishop to E6 putting pressure on the Knight first Rook to G1 and now Bishop to F5 and yes it is very very hard to say no to having a beautiful pass Pawn like this but uh Vincent's counterplay is uh evident here we have Knight to H6 attacking the bishop Knight to C6 and now Knight captures on F5 we have G captur and Knight to sorry Knight to C4 offering a trade of knights uh Knight captures we have B captur and Rook to E2 Vincent says I'm very happy with my position here I'm controlling the second rank my Bop is very strong here the Knight can come into the game how are you uh ever pushing this for more than a draw Magnus plays Rook G2 we have Rook captures Bishop captures and now Bishop to B4 offering a trade uh Bishop captures Knight captures and now Pawn to A3 attacking the Knight we have Knight back to C6 and now Bishop to H3 and here Vincent realized that he messed up uh the pawn cannot move the king is still on C8 and any Rook to f8 action will be met with the Rook to D5 and now the pawn will fall Rook captures on C5 is coming then Magnus will be up a pawn and especially if Vincent trades Rooks then it will be you know just a bishop versus a knight a pawn up on an open board this will be very very hard to defend so that is not the way to go uh with um uh 4 minutes on the clock Vincent spends almost all of his time plays Knight to A5 he's now below the 1 minute Mark uh and he says all right what do you play here and here Magnus misses his opportunity he plays Bishop captures an F5 with check as with anyone but after King to B8 he misses uh the move do you what would you play here your your C5 C4 Pawn is hanging would you advance it or would you defend it what what Would You Do Well Magnus did not played the correct C5 he played Bishop D6 and C5 really I mean it looks okay the bishop is covering C8 so you're not worried about Rook to C8 but uh it just uh fors the Knight B3 check I mean you're going to lose that pawn but that's the whole point you have to lose that pawn and you have to get the Knight to an unfavorable Square because then you can capture on H7 and you don't lose the D Pawn uh the E4 square is covered by the bishop and of course you cannot go here uh the king cannot go to C7 so you cannot attack this pawn and now this Pawn starts marching forward that was the way to go for Magnus but after King B8 he played Bishop to D6 which seems like it uh controls absolutely everything but now Vincent says Nope not so fast Pawn to B6 and now how are you stopping Knight B7 and just Rook captures there's no way to stop that King to C2 Magnus starts bringing his King into the game Knight B7 Pawn to D7 and now the only move that wins the pawn but of course Vincent sees it King to C7 Rook to F1 and now Knight to C5 attacking the bishop we have Bishop to H3 and now Knight captures on D7 grabbing that pawn equal material and now Magnus can no longer play for the win but he is Magnus he can always play for the win let's see what happens we have rooked F7 pinning the Knight King to D6 unpinning and now Rook captures on H7 he's up again again up a pawn Knight to F6 we have Rook to F7 attacking the knight and king E5 defending we have Bishop to F1 uh guarding the the pawn here so if Rook attacks you can just nicely move and you don't run into some B5 action uh Pawn to A5 by Vincent um played very Hasty but uh you know they're they're playing an increment here we have Rook to E7 check King to D four another incredibly precise move by Vincent and Rook to E6 going after the Knight and the pawn Knight to G4 and now Bishop to E2 of course advancing the pawn would run into this very unfortunate Fork so if you don't want to lose your Bishop uh or or you know give up the exchange you have to do something about that so Bishop to E2 uh Knight to E3 check you could also grab the pawn but Vincent of course will not blunder in this stage of the game if you do this you don't even have to play Rook to H6 right away you can First grab the pawn and this is still a terrible terrible threat and okay you can probably play something like King E3 but then Rook E6 checked if you go King F2 C5 it's already a winning position for white uh so after this bishop to E2 move we have Knight to E3 this comes with check King to B3 and now Rook to h8 we have Rook captures on B6 and now Rook to H7 uh Pawn to H4 Magnus starts um advancing his H Pawn but there was you know no way to defend it so he might as well push it Rook captures on H4 and now Rook to C6 defending the pawn and here Magnus is still up a pawn but um uh there is no way to play this for a win anymore Rook to H2 Rook to D6 with check King to C5 and now Rook to D2 defending the bishop however Vincent finds it Knight captures on C4 seals the deal it's an instant draw and there's nothing Magnus can do about it if Bishop captures he loses the Rook so he plays Rook to C2 puts pressure on the Knight and it seems like Vincent blunder the Knight but just Rook to H3 check and he was in this position on move 50 that Magnus Carlson agreed to a draw as there is nothing more to be done here so it is a a a great day for Germany I don't know the last time Germany had such a great day where a top German Grand Master defeats world number one in Germany I mean that I I have no idea literally when Germany had such a great day the last time but this one is to be uh remembered remembered and yeah if you go King A3 you just get checkmated so you're not playing that and if you go back like King A2 you're going to lose the a pawn and then you go further back and then Rook A4 the Knight is nicely defended there's nothing to do if anything it's still Vincent pushing for the win so but Vincent doesn't care he he he just eliminated Magnus Carlson in the semi-finals of his own tournament basically so yeah Magnus will be very sad with this one I'm sure he was looking very much forward to winning this one as he is you know as I've heard no longer playing any feay tournaments but yeah not going to happen it is Vincent in the finals and I'm not going to spoil who he's playing against as I will cover that match as well uh cindro versus Fabiano corana they're you know really brawling it out they really can't beat each other and it will take many many games for us to have a winner so I will keep you guys informed maybe the game is already finished so you guys know but yeah I'll keep you guys informed so yeah not a repetition from the 2023 World Cup even though it started similarly Magnus almost got back into the match but he gave Vincent that one chance here after King to B8 was played he he asked this beautiful question with knights to A5 what do you do do you play C5 or do you go Bishop to E6 Magnus chose the well the the the worst continuation and that was it Vincent did not falter after that and yeah I mean Vincent has been playing brilliantly against ala against Magnus he he's literally an engine this tournament he gave that okay Magnus that one chance but I'm not really sure it was um uh you know mathematically a lost position it was a position where most people would lose against Magnus I would say but still you know he didn't he didn't give him much and Indian Magnus couldn't take advantage of that so yeah brilliant play by Vincent very happy to see him in the finals and very happy to see how all this ends up uh yeah it's going to be a great great event uh so yeah hope you guys enjoyed it I would like to thank Andreas rosenal David bacon Andrew steinel Yuri renko and Nathaniel delin for your contribution to my channel thank you a lot I really appreciate it as usual you can check two of my previous videos here thank you for watching and I will see you soon continuing to check up on your wonderful suggestions but mostly covering this event until it finishes uh thank you
