    "transcript": "# Live workshop with HF co-founder and CEO: Step up your AI builder game with Enterprise Hub #\n[Music] here we go we're gonna get started with the workshop so awesome to see uh to see people joining already we already have 250 people who just joined in the past past minute so cool to see everyone so cool to see Greg I see Patrick I see Jeff who joins maybe uh maybe we can start by asking where everyone is coming from for our side we already have three locations we have Nicholas who in San Francisco we have floron who in Paris and myself I'm in Miami what about you all where where are you from can you post in the in the chat where you from okay I see uh Sak from uh from London I see Grant from Seattle I see Lis from uh from Porto why it's it's posting so fast that it's actually hard to to read them because there are too many of them coming I see G gendra from from New York I see Atul from DOA I see Alex from Boston wow there are too many too many to count I see Ursula from Hamburg I see Alfredo from buenos I see prip from DC I see MV from from Bangalore super super cool we have people from uh from everywhere we could have more more people um let's start Maybe by doing a little bit of a sharing session as you might have seen in the email that we sent at the end of the workshop and only for the people who are joining we're gonna share a very special offer for everyone to be able to upgrade to Enterprise Hub uh so we want everyone to be able to take advantage of that so let's start by all sharing on uh on our platforms with our colleagues with our team members with our friends my experience the best way to share when you're doing something related to hugging face is to do it with the hugging face emoji so uh Nico uh floron and I we're going to do the Emoji hugging face emoji sign for you get ready to take a screenshot of it that you're going to be able to share on social networks uh and also if you don't share today it's going to be like a proof for you to show that you were at the first co-founder CEO hugging face Workshop it's the first time we're doing that we might be more so you might be uh here for for for history if it ends up being very successful or if it ends up being very very bad we don't really know yet we'll see at the end of the workshop but get ready to screenshot I'm gonna put more something like that three two one okay screenshot okay awesome I'm actually gonna screenshot too like that and I'm gonna I'm going to share um at the same time as you do um so you can probably see my screen so you can share at the same time as I I share so I'm gonna put okay I'm share on the hugging face slack Channel just started the hugging face Enterprise Workshop okay time to join okay and the link is tinyurl.com huggingface live okay and I'm going to pull screenshot okay I'm gonna put this one that I took no we're not doing the hugging FaceTime there but anyway okay here it goes posting there we just crossed a thousand people joining very cool I'm going to do the same on uh Twitter um by the way it's nice to uh we're streaming on Twitter it's nice to uh talk about AI on Twitter these days the only things I see is Elon Musk talking politics which uh starts to be a bit annoying so maybe with this live stream we can make it more about AI on on Twitter right so if you following us on Twitter you can uh see the live here I would recommend by the way to click on it so that it opens in the different window and that you can keep following even if you change change Windows and here I'm going to retweet this post like it you can you can quote it you can also do it on uh LinkedIn we're also live on LinkedIn I don't know if people are following from LinkedIn but here it is the live stream the same time I check if it if it works okay that's perfect so here you can share okay repost your feed sending messages to your team members and we also live on YouTube I think here it is okay we right here I'm gonna stop the stop the sound here you can share it you can uh put the something up there okay okay so that's that's kind of like the the sharing Let's uh let me check how many people we have now in the in the live okay we have 1300 people now very very cool um I think we're ready to start I didn't introduce myself uh my name is Clen I'm the co-founder and CEO at Hing face here I'm so happy to be here with the community because hugging face is all about the community uh we started this company with my co-founder Julian Thomas eight years ago we were basically random French founders with with no network with no specific no particular skills no unfair advantage and what brought us to where we are today is really the community so I'm super excited to have uh many members of the community here um and to give kind of like a short introduction about where we are today with hugging face we've become the platform for AI Builders the community has collectively shared over 1 million public models on the hugging face platform 200,000 public data sets there are more than five million AI builders that are using us now uh and who collectively created over 100,000 organization a crazy number that we disc discovered a few weeks ago is that now a new repository is created every 15 seconds on hugging face so you can do the calculation how many new repository is there going to be created during the time of this Workshop but it's it's really uh uh insane insane numbers course so this is kind of like a short introduction about hugging face now we're going to switch to the more interesting more fun more exciting part which is the workshop and the idea is that you're going to be able to see the Showcase of some of these features but that you'll also be able to try and test at the same time so what I recommend is for you to have your live stream on one side of your screen and then on the other side to have a tab with hugging face that uh that you can play with and um to work on the workshop will have to need to create an account or log to your hugging face account so that I'm going to show you right now how to uh do that so let me switch to a different window where um I have kind of like um a window where I'm not logged in okay so you should see it now so this is the home page of fing face where you not signed up not logged in so uh to just create an account you go there okay I'm going to check test workshop at HF doco okay I'm gonna create a fake password there you go okay I'm going to create a username okay nity user near user you can do it at the same time we're GNA do Avatar a fun feature there is actually to automatically create one I'm going to do maybe uh yellow nerdy alien with ti okay here it's it's using one of the fun models on hugging face called uh sdxl Emoji which is a really cool one I'm going to like it actually at the same time um to basically generate your profile picture but you can also uh have your your general your generic kind of like a profile picture okay let's get it generate this profile picture at the same time if you already have created your account don't hesitate to post a link to it on the on the chat so that uh people can can follow follow you I imagine that right now A lot of people are creating an account at the same time and generating the profile picture at the same time which uh might make it to to be slower slower than usual I tried just uh just before and it was just taking five seconds okay so we'll skip we'll skip that part we'll create this account okay here you go oh I'm gonna have to do that I guess a lot of people are logged in right now okay I have to take the the bags oh I missed the bag okay here you go all right choose all the bag you have to confirm that I'm human because a lot of AIS are trying to create accounts too okay now you all set what you can do is create an organization right uh so I'm going to create nerdy face test right it can be any sort of things I'm going to say it's a nonprofit um and okay nerdy fa I have to do it without faces okay here you go nerdy paste test here you go and I created the my organization okay so now you all set if you created an account logged into your account created an organiz ation you can post on the chat your organization that you created so that people people can follow and now we're going to continue with uh with Nicholas and Floren who are going to show you more more of the features as I mentioned before stick until the end of the workshop because I'm gonna take back the Mike at that point and share the hack that I found for everyone to subscribe to Enterprise Hub and get all these cool cool features all right up to you now Nicholas and FL yeah thanks Clen um so the next part will have uh two sections the first part will be a um highlight of the cool public features of the Hub and so this format will be kind of a interview between me and florant me asking some of the common questions that the community has about how to best use the Hub then the second part will be about The Specific Enterprise Hub features that are only available if you sign up for the Enterprise Hub so FL can you share your screen yes um Okay can everyone see my screen right now yep so yeah I'm actually going to go directly to this e.co and uh yeah as everyone created uh an account this is the page that you can they can see once you're logged in nice so with the constant fire hose of updates all the time how can you stay up to date with uh the latest and greatest that the the community and research is putting out yeah that's a great question Nicholas so actually once you landed here on this main page of the Hub uh yeah you can get uh uh up to date with the latest models data set looking at this trending section on the right side where you can see as you can see here uh the most trending repo on the Hub is this model from Microsoft which is omnip parser which looks like to be um a screen parsing tool developed by Microsoft uh so yes on this training section you can look up for models data set also spaces we're going to see what are spaces later and you can follow people on The Hub and once You' followed them uh you can um look at what they are posting on the Hub uh so uh we so you can see posts from the different users that you are following so they can share about their work uh the model they've been developed uh you can see also what they've been liking on the Hub the different model they've likeed the different data set they like the different spaces they like and also uh you can look at for the different paper that the Hub users um share on the Hub so those are paper that they might have wrote so yeah this main page of the Hub it's kind of the um news feed for AI it's kind of a social feed for AI so it can actually replace your Twitter or exan if you want to follow uh latest development regarding a nice so it's cool that Microsoft has a top trending model I really like what Microsoft puts out there um if I wanted to keep up to date with what Microsoft is doing is there a way I could get updates from them when they post new models yeah it's a it's very easy if you like click here directly on the repo there's a button like to follow Microsoft and you if you click on it uh uh yeah you're following Microsoft and then you can find update from Microsoft directly on this feed nice so Nicholas do you want to try and and post on the Hub and try uh one of the posting uh feature of the Hub yeah I already did it it's at the top of your screen oh okay yeah right there so yeah so now uh I invite the audience as well to post post on the Hub and share about what they've been working on uh on on AI nice so hopefully we see a bunch of posts coming up in the next few minutes um but other than the latest and greatest um I know there's a lot of models on the Hub so uh how would I find the one that that I'm looking for uh yeah pretty easy so we have this big button here it's the model page so if I click on it I'm I land on the model page and as you can see and as Clen said so there are more than a million molds um available on the Hub so that's a lot um and the way that you can navigate through um those all of those models is through the filters that we have here on the Le hand side so uh We've imple implemented uh filters that allows you to filter based on the different modalities so on the Hub we uh host model for uh computer vision like text to image model for example with model from stable diffusions model we also uh cover um models uh for the audio modality with the speech recognition model and you can obviously find uh your favorite llms texture generation llm here with model from meta um meta mistal Etc so we allow also to filter um based out of the different libraries such as on NX if models have onx version you can also filter based out of License to find the most open model that are under Apache 2 or MIT and you also have a language feature to find models that cover uh a language that you might be uh interested uh for uh so let's take a look at the specific uh model so if I look let's try to look at the Lama model um so um if I cck on let's find this uh Lama 3.8 3.18 model so if I click on the the model I land on the model um page where um the author they uh share all the information regarding how the model uh has been trained what it is the usage uh maybe they share information about the license and they uh yeah so everything that the author want to share about the model is um can be written uh in this model card and on the right side you can directly play out with the model with the inference API so uh if I uh play with this widget I type some text I'm going to uh see how the model perform um we allow as well on this model page to um um to allow you to use the model directly locally or we also have different deployment options such as the inference API which is kind of a free de a free deployment option that we offer to users of the Hub and that allows you to directly interact with the model and play with it uh locally so I have a code example already made it ready for you so here uh I'm going to use the Lama 3.1 70b uh deploy through the entrance AP I and I can uh with a token that I have created on the I can directly play out with the model on this notebook so now just to make sure that uh uh the audience is like following and uh can play also with the uh with the Hub I have a question for you so I want uh um I want you to search uh for a model that is used for specifically for a text classification that is multilingual that has an on enx version and that has more than 40K download in the last mod so could you identify which model uh is this so I repeat so the model is used for text classification it is multilingual it has an onnx version and it has more than 40K download so if you can post uh into the into the comment section which model um it is all right so waiting for some answer I'm think who's gon to be the first one all right so trying it looks we'll give it another 10 seconds or so so we havea dist bird based multilingual oh actually someone has identified the right model I think Ryan you're you're the winner so I'll just give you the so so we are looking as I said for a model that is used for text classification so I can select the filter for the task which is test classification it has an onx version so I'm going to go over the libraries and search for the onnx filter okay um it is a multilingual uh so I can go to the language uh filter and select multilingual and it has 42 more than 40K downloads so I can see here that the Top Model here has 42k downloads so that's our uh model so congratulation uh Ryan who is the first one to identify the model and now uh you have example of how you can filter uh over models on the Hub nice uh so that that's how I would find a model but let's say I want to I want to customize a model could you uh quickly go over how I could find a good data set yes sure so as Clen mentioned the Hub has a million model but we also have more than two uh 200k data set um so you can find data set for uh text uh 3D data set audio data set or and even the data set that contains GEOS spatial data so similarly to the um model page uh to to the model uh page yeah you can uh have filters to navigate through all those data sets you can filter depending on the task you can filter depending on the data set size so whether you are looking at a data set for pre training that might contains billions of samples or rather that data sets of functioning that would contain uh a thousand or 10,000 samples um and yeah if you uh select if you select a particular data set such as the fine web data set that the hugging face team has created you land on this uh this particular data set card where you can uh find here um the data set viewer which will um show you some samples uh some examples of sample that are in the data set so you can audit uh if this is the data set that you are looking for and um you also have in the model card uh all the information that the auor has made the available uh such as the license why uh how to use this data set Etc and uh yeah you can directly use this data set locally um using the the data set Library we can also find here um uh models that have been trained on on this fine weight data set or spaces that are that are using these data sets so now uh I have again a second question and to see if you are following along so I want I don't know so we we're bit short on time FL so I I don't know if we should uh maybe accelerate a little bit I know we have a bunch of other features to uh yes all right so let me go by the way by the way we have over 3,000 people in the in the live right now really really cool thanks everyone for the new people who just joined to give context to everyone we showcasing the capabilities of the hugging face hub for uh for all Enterprise so we're showing a little bit of the um public features and and Nicholas is also going to Showcase some of the Enterprise features in the next few minutes yeah but uh before we go to the Enterprise F clam I just want to make sure to go over the the spaces which is uh the P spaces page which is uh one of the main feature also of the of the Hub so spaces is the way uh that we allow users to play to experiment with the models data set that are on the Hub it provides a way to create like interactive interfaces uh that you can use to demo um the models that you are um using on the Hub so I can uh give an example of spaces this one is one I like uh Facebook where I can select a photo of myself and make the head move uh if I click on some part so yeah on Spaces you can really find a wide range of demos demos for um chat demos for llms uh image uh generation demos or um uh M spech reconnection de demos so this is how so yeah this is how you can play with all of the public features now I can hand it over to Nicholas to present more of the Enterprise grade future of the H right thanks thanks flon for giving an overview of all the main public features and now we'll jump into the Enterprise Hub version which has additional features that are um very useful if you're a small startup if you're a big organization if you're just trying to collaborate with team members the Enterprise Hub has um features for everyone uh and right now we have a lot of big names that are part of the Enterprise Hub and so big names like Santa Nvidia is part of it meta aai has Enterprise Hub Liberty Mutual and many other companies as well are all part of the Enterprise Hub um and as a reminder um for everyone that maybe just joining please uh do make an account go to hf.org as well that's that's useful as well um when you do have an account you will be able to interact with our Enterprise uh Hub organization that we'll discuss in in the next few minutes um so what do you get with Enterprise Hub the main things that are useful for Enterprises are things related to uh security and access control and so single sign on is one of the biggest things that people uh mention is uh valuable when they sign on to Enterprise Hub and so if you have open ID or you have saml we have ways of connecting so that you can have SSO I'm sure a lot of people on this call are coming in from Europe and so if you want to store your data or models in Europe we have the ability to control the region that it's stored in um and then we have various other things to keep track of everything audit logs of what's being changed resource groups to uh Silo your work and we'll go into more of those details soon so Florence and I are part of this organization called nerdy face um and right now we have a few spaces we have a model and we have a data set and actually what I'm going to do first is invite everyone to join our organization called uh nerdy facee and so I'm copying a link so that people can join I'm posting it in the the chat and I'm also posting on uh hugging Faith uh a link for people to to join um and so if you search up my username NB r o a d um you can look at my posts and you can click this to join the organization um and we have some people who are asking to join it looks like we already have a ton of people joining we're already at 54 members uh 77 so that's great everyone's joining in um and so one of the things I mentioned earlier was this idea of of resource groups and so for people joining you'll probably see that there's nothing in the organization for you to for you to see or use um and that's because we've put the models and spaces into specific resource groups so right now we have two teams the fine-tuning team and the data set team uh I'm on the data set team um so I I'm an admin of that florant has read access so that means he can read some of the data sets that I share but he can't edit or modify them um and then florant is is the only member of the uh fine-tuning team right now so he has a model he also has some uh spaces for people to interact with as well so what I'm going to do is I'm going to change my uh access I'm actually going to switch uh to well I'll just go back to the organization and we're going to hop into this uh model card right here so this is the model that furat has been working on um llama V1 there's a model card that shows off what it is based on llama 3.2 1B and uses sft and DPO um but one thing I noticed is that um I'll because we know where what model it came from and because we know what data data set it used we can actually add that into the metadata and so I'm going to make a poll request to this model card and uh florant can approve this poll request and basically what what I'm doing is saying hey if we add this into the metadata we'll have the lineage visible on the on the front and then we'll connect it to what data set it was it was trained on um and so now if you go to the community section um there should be a poll request did I not make the poll request or maybe I just I think I actually just merged it into main uh so because I'm admin I can merge it into main but if I'm not admin you could also make a poll request so that's it's very uh transparent for what's actually happening and so because I made this poll request um we can now see on the right hand side that um this is a fine-tune model based on this base model this llama 3.2 1B uh we can also see that it's connected to the data set that I was working on so here's that data set that was used to train on and one of the nice features that I want to highlight for the Enterprise Hub is this data set viewer um if you're just creating private data sets you actually won't be able to view things with a viewer but if you're in Enterprise Hub you will get this viewer and so it's nice that the Hub is connecting all these resources together so the the model is connected to its base model the data set is connected to the model and then it's also connected to spaces as well um and so florant could we move this space into um out of the resource Group because right now it's it's localized to the fine-tuning team but I want to make sure that everyone in this organization can have access to it and so the idea behind this space is that floron been working on this project a while uh he's been doing a lot of training runs and now he has something that he's ready to show off to the rest of the organization and so the resource Group is really handy for isolating um the the models and tools but then when you're ready you can share it um with the whole organization and so this is running on Zer GPU which means you don't actually have to pay for the compute it's um a shared resource for hugging phas and so I can start um uh chatting with this model and it does take a while to uh potentially connect with it but then once you're connected it's uh uh very quick to to interact with so what do you call a fake noodle it's an imposta um good one nice very cool very cool it's um just and so the last thing I want to show off is the analytics um and right now there's there's no analytics here because this is a relatively new organization but if you go to something like hugging if you have an organization that's been around a while like hugging face uh you can see all the downloads over time for models and and data sets and which ones are the most trendy and so that's really high level overview of all the Enterprise features and and now I'll hand it back to Clen cool that's amazing thanks for sharing some not uh all but uh some some of the of the features of uh of enterprise Enterprise Hub as as Nicholas mentioned we have over 100,000 organizations Now using huging face uh and and a lot of them in in Enterprise as you can see in my screen here you can discover all the organizations on hugging face. organizations um also don't hesitate to share your organization on the chat again or as a reply to the Tweet because a lot of us are following us on Twitter so that everyone can uh can follow each other our goal as a company is really to make AI development more collaborative with the whole field but also internally uh at at companies so now uh the interesting this part that a lot of people were waiting for the hack to get access to some of these amazing features that uh that we went went over basically the context is when we were preparing this uh this Workshop I was kind of like testing a lot of things I was testing a lot of scenarios for grades and stuff like that and I discovered I discovered a bug or hack however however you call it so I'm gonna show you how to uh take advantage of it so to get access to it you have to go to this page uh HF doco SL SL Enterprise it's basically kind of like the page that describ some of the features uh of the of the Enterprise platform and then you can do subscribe to Enterprise Hub here I'm going to take a an organization that I have that I can use for for the test which is which is this one and as you can see here it show you a way to upgrade uh and it's uh the way it works is that it's by numbers of seats right so if you start to have quite a lot of team members in your organization it can uh it can add up pretty quickly right here on yearly billing $18 per month per seat with six members it adds up to almost 1300 right what the Hub team from hugging face has added is the ability to increase the number of seats right if you have team members that are joining later on uh but I think what they forgot is that you can actually also go down to the numbers and here you can see on the yearly you can go down from 1300 6 seats to three and if you go actually on the monthly billing you can go down to even one seat so instead of paying 1300 as you were supposed to you actually pay uh $20 for your Enterprise Hub account right and here you you can continue you put the card the card number okay here is of course I didn't put my uh my card number I already was seeing some people taking screenshots to try to get the card number of the hugging face co-founder um it's it's a fake one but you can put here uh if you want your company card your personal card something that I've seen in my experience working really well with big companies when they have annoying billing departments is you put your personal card for the first month for $20 a month basically a CH GPT subscription uh and then you tell your billing department it's going to be build again in one month we need to put the company card be careful here because what I've noticed is that the hack only works for uh one month meaning that in the next period you're you're going to be built for uh the full number of SE right um so if you want to just test it be careful switch to your company card or you can even cancel before the end of the month to make sure that you're not build in the month if you're not using the features you're not happy about the features or anything like that an interesting thing is that it works also if you subscribe with an organization with one member for example if you created the organization today with one member and tomorrow you tell all your team members to join you won't be Bild build for more uh in the next uh the next 30 days it's only in 30 days days that you'll be bued for for more so you can take advantage of all the features for a month without paying more um I'm gonna be honest I talked to Julian the co-founder and CTO at at face just before this this Workshop to tell him about the hack and I managed to convince him not to fix it before before the workshop but it told me that they're going to fix it fix it soon so I negotiated with them to have it uh not fixed for the next two hours so basically you'll be able to do this hack uh just uh in the next next two two hours um so that was it that was the the hack oh and we just crossed 4,000 people on the live stream very very cool uh thanks everyone for joining as I was saying at the beginning hugging face is all about the community so thank you everyone for for joining showing up as part of the community I see in the chat and on Twitter a lot of important members of the community who are contributing with open models open data sets with open apps uh with bug fixes on our open source libraries so thank you thank you everyone uh it's early stage for AI and what we believe in at Hing face is that we can make the whole field more open more collaborative and more positive in general hopefully this little workshop can participate a little bit in that it was the first attempts at it if you like it we'll do more of them if you have any feedback on what you didn't like just let us know in the in the comments or on social media uh but anyway thanks everyone for joining I'm gonna leave this uh Cen up screen up for a few minutes for everyone to take advantage of the hack if they want to but anyway thanks everyone for joining keep up the great work and I'll talk to you all soon thanks everyone take care [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] he n [Music] [Music] [Music] n [Music]
