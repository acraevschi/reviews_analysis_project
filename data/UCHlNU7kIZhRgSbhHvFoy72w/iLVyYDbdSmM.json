    "transcript": "# Welcome To The Agents Course! Introduction to the Course and Q&A #\nand we are live welcome everyone welcome to the first agent course live um let me see all of you uh we're going to start the live uh in two minutes so in the meantime please tell us where you come from uh in my case I'm based in Paris what about you jofrey I'm also based in Paris and Ben uh I'm based in ANP in Belgium nice so various people from Chicago Pakistan India like Paris ah yes nice um let's see Ecuador Iran Florida USA turkey a lot of people we saw that there is a lot of people from uh from USA and from India Paris nice Liverpool Canada India Saudi Arabia yeah it's really all around the world we try to find an hour that fit for everyone but you know it's very hard because you know everyone is distributed around the world so um Chile but this this will be recorded uh France bellarus Chile Nepal nice yeah very is really around the world so yeah a lot of people really excited to to create agents so it's very nice um yeah so as I said to to people who who just uh arrive um we starting in two minutes just to wait but everyone who wants to join can join Israel Florida India Tunisia yeah very nice oh we're already 2,200 people that's amazing that's really amazing um uh to be honest we I I I really thought that will be and I think we really thought that we be like I don't know 500 people so it's it's very nice to see all of you so thank you for being here um yeah I think we can we can start maybe seven yeah let's start so uh first of all hello everyone and welcome and thank you for being here uh for this first live of the agent course uh the first thing we want to do is to introduce ourselves so my name is Tomas simonini I'm a developer Advocate at hugging face and I'm um I'm some people know me in this live because I wrote The Deep reinforcement learning course two years ago um and also work on the AI in Games part at Hing face and currently I'm one of the co-creator with jeofrey and Ben of the agent course what about you Joffrey hi um nice to meet you everyone I'm Joffrey so I'm a machine learning engineer from huging face and um I was working in the monetization team and now um my focus is on agents what about you Ben thanks I'm Ben I'm a machine learning engineer and I've given courses in in data sets and in posttraining llms and uh I worked on course as well and I focused on most of the llm material and I I built the quizzes and the certifications and yeah those are my favorite parts of the course as well in case you have any questions about okay so let's get started um so uh for people who don't know uh this live is about the agent course it's a new course uh at hugging face where you will learn it's a free course from beginner to expert uh the goal of the course uh is to teach you how to create agent um so it's a free course and I I think you already know that you know agent is really the topic in AI in 2025 uh we see a lot of companies being created around that you know we see a lot of project about that and so I think it's really the skills to acquire this year and fortunately with this course you're in the right place um on this course we have already 72k uh signups which is amazing and we want to thank you for that and we really hope you're going to like it we work really hard for that and so let me just uh give you some information about how the this live is going to to to happen uh there will be a first part which is a presentation of the course when I will give you a little bit of information about the course the scope the units and the challenges and then there will be a Q&A uh during around 30 minutes and after that we will have a small surprise to to announce um and one thing is that don't hesitate to start to ask your question now in the chat so that you know my my colleague can you know check the the question um so as I said uh we launch the course um like uh on Monday and so you can have access here with this link uh at h.n agent course um okay sorry so there is two ways to find the course uh the first is uh with this link which is hf.org anization of the hugging face Hub uh this this is where you're going to find the quizzes uh the space uh everything you need to do the enzone and this is also where there is all the links of the course and the second link it's hf.com Z and one are published one thing I want to mention is that we have a Discord server where we I really advise you to join because it's it's a place where you will be able to exchange with us exchange with your classmate and ask questions to do together I think it's always easier when you study something new to to to be able to participate with multiple people um and this is also where we give the latest update information so the link you have the link here which is h.c sorry SL jooin Discord um but you also have the link uh in the course when you go to unit zero and you do the onboarding um also um the best way to keep being updated about the new unit the new update Etc is uh to sign up to the course uh so if you already signed up to the course you should have received some mails from us if it's not the casee please check your spam uh folder and if not uh the link is here uh also you have the link directly when you go to to the the course directly you have a link uh to to sign up to the course so yeah someone asking yeah it's free the course is completely free there is no uh it's totally free it's totally open source so it's it's uh you it's totally free uh yes and also the video is recorded um so again so what I said I put I put the link um and what I said is that it's uh really the best moment to start to learn about agents and so we prepared something very nice for people to start with the theory than the practice so that you know your at the end of this course you have a very strong Foundation to be able to build your own agent so to give a little bit more of information about what we do during this course you're going to study AI in Theory design and practice the idea is that we don't we we also want in addition to the enzone that you understand the theory behind the agent so that when you will use a new library you will be able to rapidly you know uh keep up the pace with this library because you will have the theory and so it will be much easier to understand how to use new libraries you're also going to use establish AI agent libraries such as small agent long long chain and Lama index you're to share your agent on the hugging face Hub and explore uh agent created by the community and you'll participate in challenges where you will evaluate your agents against over students this will be during the unit four and finally you will hun two certificate of completion by completing assignment um we think that it's important the certificate are important because this is a good way to show to your employer or future employer that you have the skills on about agent so yeah again uh I put the link uh of of the course so uh but in any case what if you didn't get the link what you just need to do is that you type on Google you know h.c learn or agent course bying phas and you will find it I just want to emphasize rapidly on the free pass that you can do during this course uh the first is to participate as an auditor uh where you it just you know you want to read one of the unit but you know don't do the wall certification process um what I something important because I see in some question this um you don't need to tell us which PA path you you you you choose it's very because it's already it's automatic what I mean is that if you you pass the quiz of the unit one you can get a certificate if you pass the unit one a use case assignment and the final challenge you can get the completion certificate so what I mean is that you don't need to tell us you just you know do the quizzes and the assignment and then you go to the certificate section and you can generate your certificate my advice is at least try to do the certificate of fundamentals because I think it will since you will get a good foundational agent it will be important and useful for your career to be able to show you know this certificate to say I pass the agent course bying phase so it shows that you have some skills in agent so if you don't want to do the world course at least I think it's important to earn a certificate of fundamentals all this information that I'm telling you by the way will also be are also in the unit zero uh during the onboarding one important thing is that we sorry could I just add a bit there on the fundamentals sure so one aspect to the fundamentals that you should know is that the quiz doesn't require any code so you can get that certification without following the code components which we think is really good for like decision makers and people that don't use code but they're really interested in in agents and they want to work on agentic projects and get a certificate for that so just know that that's yours kind of certificate if you don't use code yeah yeah good yeah uh so there is one deadline um it's you need if you want to get the certificate uh you need to do the assignments and finish before May the 1st 2025 so to help you to be on time with the with the deadline what we done is that we created what we call a recommended pace obviously this is just a recommendation you can you can work at your own pace but we we provide you this recommended pace where you see the syllabus and you see you know what week we advise to to work on um so yeah just to rapidly quick uh to to go to the to syllabus um you have unit one where it's already published it's an introduction to agent you have a theory part and a practice part you're going to create your first agent using small agent uh next week we have a bonus unit where you will learn to find your agent after that we will have unit about Frameworks such as longchain uh Lama index and uh small agent and on the third unit will have the use case like how you can use agent in real world you know what type of use case you can use with you know an assignment and at the end you will have on unit four what we call the final assessment where you will create an agent and you're going to Benchmark against over um over classmates the idea is that we're going to build a leaderboard where you will be able to um Benchmark your agent but we will give you at the weeks go by we're going to give you more information about the syllabus because it's a work in progress uh based on your feedbacks that's why at the end of the section we have a feedback form that you can feel and it help us to know which element you want us to add etc etc so don't hesitate to fill them um I just want to scheme rapidly on the best practices to succeed in this course they are always the same go on Discord don't hesitate don't be shy we have a very nice Community very friendly and I want to thank personally the personally sory the people who really help on the Discord server but answer question I see that the community is very active so it's very it's very nice thank you for that so yeah Discord is really the place where you can you know exchange find classmate Etc it's very nice also in each unit we have what we call ungraded quizzes that will help you to verify that you really grasp the material so don't hesitate to take them it's really important I think to be sure that you really you know that you not fall into what we call illusion of competence and finally Define a schedule to stay sync because you know as I said there is a deadline so don't don't so I think it's important that you have at least every week you know you work on one part of the units and yeah you need you don't don't need a lot of tools because a lot of people ask me you know can I use my phone and I will not advise to use your phone because you will need to code so you will need a computer and you will need aing face account and a free account is good enough you don't need a paid account for this course uh one thing I I didn't forgot to mention the requirement for this course is you need to have at least some skills in Python and you need to have a little bit of you know a little bit about llm large language model if it's not the case we put in unit zero and unit one links that you can check you know we have an NL natural language processing course that you can follow but uh my advice is that you need to already have a little bit of skills in Python in code and a little bit in llm but in any case if you are very motivated we give some links to to this course so you will be able to keep up the pace and one last thing be before I we move to Q&A uh there is fre way that you can help us to promote the course the first is to like this video because it helps to reach more people the second is that we have a GitHub repository where we put the course which is github.com huggingface Agent course and liking ing or GitHub report helps to make it more visible to the GitHub community and finally don't forget to follow the agent course organization uh uh because it's also where you will have all the information and the main entry point for all the over links so again this is the link of the course and I think now it's time for Q&A uh one thing uh if you have technical question about you know I can join this c um I have PR you know generating my certificate or you know on the quiz um I think the best is on the certificate space on the quiz space Etc to go to the discussion tab uh because this where we can track and we can you know rapidly check what's going on based on your username so that you know we can check if you pass this quiz if the certificate is generated ET it's much easier for us and so now I let my two colleague to uh to answer your question and if we don't have time to answer your question don't hesitate to ask in uh the agent course question channel on Discord hi so the first question that uh I noticed was this one it was about Python and it said what would you suggest for those who are not familiar with python and to get the most out of the course so yeah this is a really good question one that I'm I'm really interested in as we said the first unit of the course doesn't requ ire python to complete but it does show some Python and it does guide you through some steps and obviously if you don't understand that programming language you're going to find those parts of it quite difficult um and so we suggest that you go to the reading material and you focus on the fundamentals and you get the most out of those fundamental parts of the course from unit two to three it's for um python programmers and so those units won't be won't be ideal for you and it's that first unit that you should focus on we're also going to release bonus units in the future and those bonus units will have kind of different Target audiences and they could be like no code bonus units if that's something that you want and so if you really enjoy that first unit and because it's no code then say that in the forms um and push us that way and we'll release content like that yeah sorry for the nonf French the this question is in French but I will translate so basically this question is asking if the the course will be available in French and let's uh extrapolate in other languages too so at the moment it's not this is an English only um course but if you wish to to support your local language you can do PRS to translate in other languages so uh a short question about another course that we've done in the over the last few months about small course this was an experimental course on loads of different subjects and it was really a way of finding out what the community wants and this course is different to that one uh and it um is fully fledged it's interactive U and it has material that you can follow along and live sessions like this small course was kind of static and and asynchronous and and small and so they're very different courses and if you're here then you probably know that and that's great I saw this question uh talking about the NLP course so do you recommend doing this after the AI agent course this would be the other way around like if you feel that at some point you don't have the NLP background it would be better to do the NLP course first but uh that being said in the agent course we start from scratch so all knowledge that is necessary to understand agent are u in the uh um unit one okay I'm going to answer two questions in a row that are both about timeline the first one here is that why is there a hard deadline on the 1 of May um in real terms the deadline is is not that hard but it is is about creating a kind of cohort and a group of students that are studying and discussing together so that we can all collectively get the most out of it and kind of motivating ourselves the certification process runs in parallel so we can collect certifications as you go you can adapt the pace to your own life and and you can move slower and faster in various Bits And if you're um getting your certificate after that date uh we're going to support you in that if you need and so it isn't a really really hard deadline it's about creating a small community that's working on something at the same time the other question about timing was how much time commitment is required this is um not an easy question to answer really because it depends on on your own life and and how deep you go we're saying around three to four hours per week uh per unit sorry as we release them and we're going to release a unit every two weeks we have some bonus units in there there's a lot of written material there are exercises that you can go deeper on than than we encourage so I'd say there's um three to four hours is sort of minimum and you can take it up from there I saw question asking about the longchain part so is it longchain agent or long graph in fact it's going to be both because we are going to start explaining the the principles of longchain and then moving on to L graph so I saw this question do we need a GPU for this course but I'd kind of extend this out as well say what sort of Hardware do we need for this course no you don't need a a GPU we use uh inference apis and the hub for the course and so and we also use a number of smaller models at various part of the course so you don't need a GPU if that was something that you had you could kind of get more out of the course you could try different models from The Hub or you could download those and kind of take it further and uh that would be pretty cool and quite exciting so it's definitely something you can take advantage of but you should be able to run this on a on a general uh computer nothing fancy just that you can access Python and that will take you all the way to the end of the course I'm seeing question about which which kind of llm are we going to be using so at the moment in unit one we used two uh but I'll try to be um as generic as possible meaning like in future unit we will use other llms and small uh LM that we haven't used in previous units okay sorry um okay so this question asked about the C certification process and the person said that their hugging face account doesn't have their their full name that's okay uh within the certification process you can Define whatever name that you like but the the certificate will be attached to your hugging face profile and the reason that we do that is is just so that the certificate has validity and it links back to her profile because this is just something that um people want with certificates so that they're not just an image that they actually have some kind of credential and and people know that they're a valid certificate so it just kind of adds some some value to you to have those certificates because they're they're maintained and they're linked back to a reference so can we make the final assignment if we do not have prior knowledge of LM that's the purpose of the course uh is to guide you through from no knowledge of n llm to being able to actually code um an agent and compete in a in a benchmark in a leaderboard against other students this question asked why have you chosen only three Frameworks okay I mean you could ask the question both ways why have we chosen three Frameworks and and not one most courses will just choose a framework and teach you through it and um I I suppose we could choose 10 10 Frameworks the reason we haven't chosen more than three is because we don't think it would be a a feasible course for us to build to a high standard and and for students to follow that's that's a lot of Frameworks to learn in a few months and in reality most people don't really need more than a few why have we chosen three and not one well that's because we wanted to build an agnostic course that wasn't really about Frameworks Frameworks are just a way of doing something this course is about agents and about the fundamentals and understanding them and we've chosen three of what we think are the best Frameworks out there and if you look at the statistics on them they're the most used as well and they're kind of three diverse Frameworks so three diverse tasks so that's why we've chosen those so is this course relevant for project managers uh we are trying to make this course as general as possible so that's what we divided it into multiple units unit one is here for the fundamentals so if you feel that your python uh skills are too light at some point it's it's okay to to just read the materials and not do the coding steps um and not necessarily like do the final assignment which will be a little bit more code uh demanding so this is a kind this is a cool question I really like it um what was your motivation to come up with a course at this moment in time can you share more of the perspective about AI agents in the industry to 2025 it's a really kind of long-winded question maybe Joffrey wants or Thomas want to answer this as well after me because it's kind of like just a a position question um so for me my personal place in it is that I've been building small courses around llms and teaching people how to use LM at different kind of levels and um it's really exciting but it's as we move into agents that they actually become both exciting and kind of fully usable so it's really where you let these models loose and you can actually do things with them also now in 2025 like the problem of inference and compute seems to be way less significant than it was the year before and people can actually access a diverse range of models on the Hub and so we can kind kind of get closer to building applications and switch between different open source models so there's so much more you can kind of do there without needing to worry about hardware and go into those kind of complexities which means that more people can build this stuff so so for me that was why this is the right time to build AI agents and there's also a wider range of of Frameworks and libraries out there now so from small agents up to to langra there's kind of more to learn there than there was here ago so maybe are there only Theory or video tutorials um it's exactly the right time to ask this question there's going to be uh an optional unit next week that is going to cover fine tuning um that I'm going that I recorded and it's a video in death case cool uh this question asked was kind of extra study material I finished the first unit yesterday what should I do to practice in preparation for the future units so we've added links throughout the material that you can collect and kind of go off and do some extra reading uh and obviously it's not a it's not two weeks of material that you know 80 hours of work or something it's definitely not not that much and and it kind of will fit in most people's lives so there's a lot of space there personally I'd encourage you to go through the reading material first and kind of collect that together and go into that I'd then encourage you to kind of enter into the discussions in Discord and if you really feel like you're getting your head around that material then maybe you're one of the um you know one of the the Vanguard students a bit further ahead and maybe you can help your colleag and kind of work through those questions and maybe some of those questions are quite difficult for you and you can go back and work on those and help each other that's really cool and then maybe you can go back to the exercises and kind of go deeper on them and build more complex applications and start to find the limits of your abilities so that you can have ideas about the kinds of use cases that you'd want to build or or what you find interesting and challenging because then as you come into unit 2 and you start to see framework then you'll start to think okay now I I know there's this problem I want to solve maybe this itch I want to scratch how can I do that with this framework and you'll start to unpack and grow like that that that would be my my recommendation so does this course require knowledge about the hugging face ecosystem well um the course is happening on hugging face and we are using a lot of hugging face tools so this is something that we need to work through to to get you that knowledge about using the hugging pH ecosystem but hopefully um the lesson are clear enough so that you you get that knowledge on the goal cool so this question asks can we use an agent as a slm a small language model or just a large language model an llm so um yeah this is a a difficult question in the sense that they're not really two separate categories you know there's a bit of a spectrum and on that Spectrum you have small models of 135 million parameters if you look at the smallest smaller models and models right the way up to 72 billion parameters if we look at quen really powerful models and even some models with greater parameters than that but those models are really relevant to the task at hand so there might be some tasks that are about structuring text and restructuring text in certain formats and smaller language models can can do that and they can do it pretty effectively and you might be able to find that a 1.7 billion parameter small LM can perform that task uh and maybe even smaller than that then you might work on a on a kind of reasoning or math or code problem and that that model probably might not be able to do that and so you'd go up to a a 7 billion or even 72 billion parameter model in order to perform this kind of complex task and I'd encourage you to to explore that and to find out both what models of certain sizes can do and what they can't do uh and if you've got kind of real Hardware constraints um then I would encourage you to focus on small language models and to work on TKS that they can solve and to figure out what that is um so are we going to see use case that show how to move in production environment or AI agent um exactly so basically uh at the moment we only s the fundamentals but going on with next week we're going to see for works and unit three is about use cases and use cases is actually building a real case like you would be in production into um to to fulfill an objective so I I think it relates to your question so this question asks about submitting code as part of the assignment for the unit completion so in unit one as we mentioned there's no code submission these are multiple choice questions within a quiz format that are that challenge your understanding of the fundamentals as we go on we will um grade we will not use quizzes in every single unit for assessment and in the third unit we may use a quiz kind of based on feedback on where people are going and that might be a kind of more code related quiz because units two and three challenge those things but what we're certain of is that there will be an assignment at the end of the project which does contribute towards your sort of certificate of completion so does the course teach VM agent and vision agent uh yes it will to some extent um VM are really used oh sorry are really used as tools um in onance we browsing um so this is a fundamental also um component of what we need to to learn in order to to complete the last assignment so this question asks whether we'll build deep research um deep research agents that's how I understood it like the ones recently released by open AR and or even the open alternative by the makers of of small agents I'm not sure if that's going to be a specific as the specific title of of one of the exercises but we're working towards a guia style evaluation and that's very similar to that application and so in effect if this was something that really interested you you could definitely Point your final exercise towards that kind of use case and maybe add an interface on top of that and work on that I'm not sure if Joffrey wants to add anything more to that question because that's perfect perfect answer so basically open deep research just took the second place of the Gaia Benchmark and the goal of the final assignment is a Gaia style Benchmark with different question and so if you want to reproduce that kind of um of of coding that they did in open deep research this is totally possible here's another nice question um are we building our own agents or building on top of other models so uh This what I I get from this question is maybe that you want to take a look at some of the chapters in the r material what are agents what are llms and kind of go through that section and just to get an idea of of the difference between an agent and a model so when we talk about models we're talking about the llm at the core of the agent this is a a set this is a a binary process it's it's not a piece of code it returns back a kind of reasoning or or text that it's generated about a decision the agent as a whole is a is a system that um reacts and and acts upon events and and and performs those those functional steps based on the decisions made by that llm at the course the model of the course so they're two different things and um will you you'll be building agents using existing models from the hubs and you won't make any real modifications to those models you'll just be building agents so does this course connect llm agent with agents might be a question for Thomas but basically no LM agent are very different from LL agents so if you're interested in erl agent instead you may be better by checking the the Perl course yeah there is a it does not connect um except you know if you train your LM using lfh but the Deep reinforcement learning course is not on this topic is more on classical deep reinforcement learning from Q learning to PO so now there is no connection between both but eral course is also a very good course I'm not very objective because I wrote it but yeah if you're interesting on that after the agent course obviously you can join so this question asks are we going to see use cases that that show how to move into production environment this isn't something that we're really discussing in the course um yeah we don't have a kind of production unit but definitely a unit that I could see and I could definitely see it as a bonus unit what I'd say is that the libraries that we're using are are robust and and a use across the industry so the transition from these agents to Something in production is not um is not unimaginable right it's it's you'll be using the same code and you'll need to consider oper operationalizing that but um if that's something that you really want I'd go to the feedback form and I'd mention it and we'll definitely introduce a bonus unit on that there's a few people at hugging face that I think would really enjoy making a bonus unit like that so um yeah please bring that up so the crisp question uh are we using DPS exactly this is part of the plan at the end of uh unit one in the final assignment the model that is currently in the template of the final of the unit one final assignment your first agent is a deeps distilled model so in in that sense you are already using deeps as part of unit one the deeps will come back uh in later units too cool so this question asks is there any limitation for the number of attempts that that uh you can make so no there's no limitation in fact you could even try to follow all of the units right at the end end of the the period and collaborate differently it's completely self-paced and you can run through those as many times as you as you need my recommendation would be if you do take the test that to and you and you don't pass would be to go back to the written material and kind of take take another look through that and and then try again I wouldn't kind of try to Brute Force the quiz you you may pass it if you've got enough time but I I think you'd probably only be wronging yourself because some of the stuff we're covering in this unit one is actually fundamental and um the components of unit 2 rely on it and so getting the most out of unit 2 relies on those kind of fundamental components so I'd really encourage you to to try and then go back and and iterate like that so there's a another question on the final assignment how is it evaluated so if you look at the GAA Benchmark actually uh they here some ground truths answers so there's a a question you have a series of task to performed it is usually either having tools like web search having tools that uh can evaluate like look at a local file or this kind of thing and then at the end of multiple steps there is a ground through sensor and this is a kind of exact match pairing so this is going to be the same it's going to be evaluated from um a a computer program uh a code that is going to check the ground truth of the question to uh the precomputed ground TRS but those question are usually pretty hard so um there's no way you you get the maximum score on those kind of benchmarks so this question asks about olama but I would just extend it out to other like inference tools inference libraries and platforms we use um inference apis that are integrated into the Hub most of the way through the the um the course and the the reason for that is that these are kind of consistent and things that we can give you the most support on and make it easier for you to ask questions and know whether it it's you or the model that that's creating a problem we kind of reduce down the the number of constants so that we can just make it easier to support you and not have a kind of um too many too many libraries and too many variables in the learning process like a llama Or BLM these kind of other Alternatives that said all of the Frameworks that we're using have really wide selection of inference options and so you can kind of follow along the course and learn the fundamentals and learn about agents and then you can go away to those Frameworks and learn about their Integrations and you'll also be able to swap between models on different inference platforms so you'll be able to say Okay I I used small lm2 via hugging face inference endpoints and now I'm going to use that same model via ol and run it locally and you'll be able to swap those out or you'll be able to switch over to proprietary apis like open AI or ropic or Google and and try your agents out in that way but uh the course keeps it kind of simple so that we can help each other the best so should we have knowledge of machine learning fundamentals like by propagation stochastic calculus soft Max and so on um this is a nice to have obviously uh but the fundamental in unit one easier to normally um even out the knowledge of everyone cool um this is a similar question to the last one do we code on our devices or are there a Sandbox so the way that the course has been built is that are many of the units use spaces on the hubs and not and notebooks there um we also have spaces and you can spin up your own notebooks you will'll give you template spaces that you can duplicate and try out in different ways so actually um you don't need to do that kind of uh that much environment Management on your own machine and if you've got say you know a Windows machine or or a Chromebook or these kind of um various machines as long as you can connect to a browser and you can get it to spaces you'll be able to go quite far with the course and go along with the coding test so maybe related question how exactly do we use llm with agents so do you need external API um no this do we have something called the SS API where in which you can already call some of the most trending uh model directly from the hugging face environment so this is what we use um and in any case we can also provide some inference end point with the model deployed for the content of this course so you don't have nothing to pay to follow this course so um this question asks about the field of llms and and if there are any kind of prerequisites that that would support this course I would say that the agent course comes in right after the I think um part three or four of the NLP course where you start to talk about tokenizers and using LL using in that in that course models for inference it comes in right after that and it actually carries on explaining tokenization and chat templates and inference it it leads on really well from the NLP course there's some material in that NP course that aren't relevant here like for example fine tuning models and these kind of things we won't do any of that in the agents course so you can take the that certain part of the NLP course and follow on into this one and they they work together quite well I think and they'll just give you a bit of um background knowledge that said if you've been using llms for the last year or so you have a basic understanding of tokenization basic understanding of generation we're going to build on top of that basic understanding with a bit more information and then you can kind of go from there so does this class as agent security related content um I would say at the moment not directly we will grasp a little bit of that on when we talk about Frameworks for instance code agent are in a sense very free uh because they can code their own tool and they can then call them uh while Json agent are less free and we have some some framework that are very free like small agent on one end of the spectrum and some framework that are very deterministic like L graph on the other end of the spectrum so this is where we will tackle a little bit in agent security uh which is related to going to production you you want something secure if you if you need uh your agent to actually do something um something meaningful so this is in that context that we will talk about it this is another question that I I I just find really interesting even though it's quite a simple question can I use JavaScript instead of python the answer is no for this for this course in its current format but uh it personally is something that I think we could definitely work on and it would definitely be cool if this course was was rebuilt in typescript and JavaScript so that more people could use it we're dependent on the libraries that we're using but there are libraries in in other languages that are really compatible so it's one of those things again if this is something that's really important to you and it makes total sense to build agents in JavaScript there's no kind of python specific attributes that we really want for agents then um I would start to talk about that on Discord I'd start to bring it up in the form and maybe kind of Build Together a sort of JavaScript agents Community which I would definitely love to become the ambassador of and uh so yeah if that's something that you want let's let's talk about it but right now it's not something that's in the course and we've already got a python implementation unfortunately um I think there is two I can answer very rapidly uh was one about um um if we're going to do lives and in uh and when yes we think to do more lives during the course uh we keep you updated with the email and Discord uh we try to find an hour that fit for most of people because you know as I said it's very complex since you all distributed around the world so we will keep you upd on that and there was another about you know how how this course you know is not going to be obsolete um the idea of course at huging face is that there is a first version that is made by us and by the community and then we try you know people can contribute and we current we always try to update based on what's Happening you know agent is a very fast topic you know in term of things are moving fast so yeah for for at least the next month next TR will be updated and then you know it's an open source course so IDE is that the community can always partici ipate and one last for my from my side is can we get Hing face agent swag stuff like that uh we don't promise anything for no but we are thinking about you know stickers and stuff like that but again it's not decided yet but we would love to do that we also uh I we made some illustration and stuff like that that you can already share um and so we also on Discord we want to create like stickers and stuff like that that you can put you know on your message uh but yeah not everything is is already you know decided on that but yeah there is some things that we're working on and I think we have time for at least one or two question I think and for the over if um we we do apologize if we don't have time to answer your question but you can ask us during the next weeks like today tomorrow Etc on agent cour course question and also in the upcoming uh um lives so maybe this one last question oh sorry yeah go ahead one last question I noticed was is it possible to finish before the deadline um in real terms no because we um we'll release that last unit and that last um assignment and that will lead up to the deadline so there's a certain amount of leeway if you worked faster on that very last assignment and you'd be able to finish before then but uh you wouldn't be able to kind of do the whole course in the next week you'd need to wait for the the next few units to be released and once that last units released you could go fast from there and finish early and the reason for that as I said before is that we're kind of maintaining a community and a cohort people that are working through it together and last question on my side so what happens is somebody fails the test can he she try again uh and does he she gets the certificate anyway so for this question there's going to be two certificate one for the fundamental which is on quiz uh that quiz can be taken again as many time as you wish until you meet the minimum criteria uh of 80% and so you you can take it again and again uh if you fail it there's no problem and on the final assignment which is going to be code related where you going to have to send your result result to a leaderboard we're going to have a passing grade let's say um there's 50 question you need to at least have 25 out of 50 correct um the this is the passing grade and you can also retest As Long As You Wish until you you meet that certain criteria so there's no no failing basically and the one thing I would add there is that for that final quiz it's your agent that needs to answer those questions and you so you can try as many times as you like yeah exactly um so let's move on for the um surprise I let Ben explain okay so this comes from our colleagues at at gradio and and the small agents Library which you'll be familiar with you'll use both these libraries in the course and this and it's a it's a hackathon it's a live and and partially hybrid event we're told and it will use all of the skills that you're going to build up on the course it's that last week of March the date shown on the slide there one of those weekends and so this is a great moment for you to apply these skills you will already be familiar with both of these tools and building agents for them and so this is a chance to kind of um yeah use it practice one thing I would really encourage is you to come together as students and and we'll kind of support that and if there were a whole series of small uh sorry agent course teams that you work together on and went to this hackathon that would be really cool um and it would be cool to see you on the leaderboard for that hackathon yeah and we will give you more information in the upcoming days and weeks um don't so don't forget to up to Discord and to the mail to get the latest information cool and then this is just a recap really of everything that we've said at the beginning and through all these questions just before we close so if you need to stay up today uh you don't want to miss anything as the course moves forward the first thing to do would be to follow the organization on the Hub the way that HF works the way that the Hub works is that any kind of changes whether they're bug fixes comments anything you'll you'll get um you'll get notifications you'll see that on your on your feed and so you'll know is of course evolved especially when the new units come out uh and it's also a nice way of kind of getting an inside line on some of the material I noticed a few students were working on the quiz kind of before the material came out so if you want the inside line uh definitely follow the or on the Hub as you said a few times join the Discord if you want to uh discuss things and speak to students also studying another way of getting the inside line on our material is to Star the GitHub repo and then you'll get notifications about our pool request so you kind of see the material even before it's published uh and that's the best way of getting that um that inside information if you're already working on the material and you have questions kind of about the the subject about agents I would first go to Discord start a thread if you like if you see an interesting comment there already and um start to ask questions I've noticed that a number of students are are very engaged and are kind of taking the conversation up and we're doing our best to join in um as many conversations as we can so I would go there if you um have kind of technical issues like you're not sure if you know the the application is broken or is your code wrong and you really just want help with errors and bugs and things like this I would take those to the hub and to the spaces and so that way the various Builders of those tools can help you right there it just makes more sense instead of stuff getting kind of lost in Discord so I would go to the hub for those kind of things and then going forward what should you do straight after this uh live session well um if you've already finished the material let's say I would go and get your certification so I go and take the quiz and then do your certification and if you want you can you can share that um it's already got a link so you can add it to your LinkedIn and stuff um and then I would look out for the new units coming if you followed us in on GitHub and and on the Hub then then you'll get notifications about that and then I would also look out for more live sessions like this one and like the kind that we've discussed during the session just to yeah so we can see you again and and that's everything from the recap yeah thank you very much um thank you all for being here uh we are super happy uh I think both of us didn't thought that we will get this amount of signups we are about 74k signup which is like crazy and amazing at the same time um yeah so thank you very much for this live um we'll see you next time and uh yeah keep learning and stay awesome bye thank you very much bye everyone",
