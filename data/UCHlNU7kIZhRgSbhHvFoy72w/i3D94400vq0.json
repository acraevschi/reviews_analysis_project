    "transcript": "# LeRobot Hackathon - Sunday #\nit's you [Music] ESP BL my mist thank you so [Music] much thank you let you for no it's good [Music] bu for you hear me [Music] what [Music] for [Music] for for [Music] everyone okay let's get started um so what we what we can do this morning is focus on data recording uh and then training model um we have this afternoon will go through the reinforcement track uh if you really want to do LL uh this morning feel free to reach out to Alexander here um so also we really want to focus on data recording so if your robot is not working it's okay uh go to a team where their robot works and uh so that you can learn data data recording we go through everyone to make sure everything works and um and then we'll try to fix the the robots that that don't work um see [Music] by going [Music] just say that could solve the problem we got so good so [Music] now and [Music] know for h [Music] okay say like hi sorry [Music] I'm I'm okay try the okay you back there for [Music] same better let power [Music] brother for [Music] MO prob [Music] that's [Music] hello to know if we still have some tripods left yeah thank you [Music] [Music] m for the camera do do we need to have the the robot arm in in full vision even when it's straight like that or do we only need to F the the table uh I thinkable okay thanks [Music] [Music] we don't have you will see power [Music] monitor that [Music] [Music] but h MI okay video [Music] like spe [Music] for all [Music] I think one of these no she [Music] like ready hey what's up [Music] [Music] I

[Music] [Music] know for [Music] says yeah yeah yeah in the middle of dropping from 20 cm [Music] is working we have we have I think we have what what does that say you have to get h [Music] at night [Music] [Music] [Music] what what the what [Music] a that [Music] value you wanton five minutes now [Music] [Applause] that h [Music] [Music] we do that right some [Music] no I [Music] [Music] right yes I ni [Music] Che for [Music] m I B for [Music] make lower and the arm is the that's why I I give it aen try I [Music] for for [Music] St don't [Music] [Music] [Music] next [Music] 10 for and everything they align [Music] on you [Music] [Music] why helps a good question the [Music] okay guess what I have that's as it's for just want to tell you good [Music] so [Music] for [Music] for [Music] for for you [Music] oh [Music] [Music] ni [Music] see why 6 [Music] position change for e [Music] so between this is the one [Music] [Music] you sorry [Music] on for for PE [Music] it's

[Music] yeah I know um [Music] [Music] okay the okay 24 Pizza take [Music] some [Applause] than [Music] to EP for be [Music] want [Music] again [Music] spe for [Music] is [Music] people that are going well they have [Music] [Music] [Music] just [Music] [Music] what your the the pizza will arri in one hour so uh be prepared [Music] until we find yes spe [Music] you I have few training let's I mean just exist [Music] warn you down the bottom you cre a bball [Music] [Music] said one thing everyone so we are going to so this the step is 7 p.m. we need to leave the room at 7 p.m. but of course we start cleaning at 5m especially so you don't need to disassemble the arms or whatever um so just that at 500m we are going to to pack all the thing we can do but the arm so that you can still work on on them and then at at 6 we'll start to pack the arm uh those arms they are extremely useful for us because there are many assembly assembling issues calibration issues and we want to uh to bring them back to Paris to solve all those issues and then to make them available for the next haon in Paris so you're welcome also to come in Paris maybe we announce it maybe in December or something and uh yeah so so thanks a lot for spending the time on on the assembly with us it's a lot of learning for us in particular we want to to simplify the code to validate every step of the assembly so that we don't have to dis the arms if there is a calibration is or this kind of stuff so yeah it's still still a prototype uh so thank you so much for your help on that and I hope you had fun making the operation works and so okay thanks [Applause] [Music] so with that main policy issue did you guys really no IDE [Music] y the Third oneul [Music] is go [Music] another for I I [Music] now [Music]

have on the yeah on the page of the most you will have all the link to buy the motors directly on P and the brackets um the motors bu and so on and you you should receive it in two weeks so it's quite fast and and just this is the remaining part that you will need for now and we we plan to we want to work on a second version which will use the the same Motors but this part won't be needed anym no to [Music] one no [Music] okay for open all e I sure us did we that's [Music] to for [Music] [Music] just what e [Music] en um and [Music] am [Music] rece of the for [Music] for for [Music] St for for
