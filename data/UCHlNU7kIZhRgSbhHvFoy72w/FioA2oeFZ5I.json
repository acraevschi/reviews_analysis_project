            "comment": "is it just me or is there no sound? and I have no idea what other people are talking about, these steps are virtually incomprehensible. Step 2 with removing the gear was like five feet away from the part in question and hard to see, an was only onscreen for a second or two. Spent 100x that time watching the guy turn screws. How is this helpful at all? Could he not afford a tripod? I can't even watch without getting nauseous",
