            "comment": "Anybody knows about an OS that has \"nested kernels\" or \"nested idle mode\" ?!\n\nThe Idea is that the PC gets a Role, say \"a keyboard mirror\", \n and every Role has idle time, in which it can take on the secondary role of \"Application Support\",\n   in which it can run some other Role as a Sub-Role, and is responsible for it's actions,\n   it gaurd the PC from any abuse coming from the sub role.\n\nIt's more deterministic and less dynamic than the Real-Time Linux Kernel .\n\nButtom line, when creating an application for this OS, one must find \nan valid supporting app that will run this app when idle, and one must decide if this app \ncan have sub apps, and if so, it is responsible for adding app-support code.\n(there is code duplication, but it's ok because it must be maintained separately, and up/down the\n nesting - sharing protocols can be set for code developement)\n\nJust A Thought.",

Me being me, decided to set up a never-ending loop that would lock the machine and frustrate the people working :) I seem to remember that there was an even simpler key combination on BBC Model B machines that caused problems in schools that had them.  :)",
