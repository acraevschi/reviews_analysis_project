We all need a paycheck right now, and it's mad easy to pay no mind to the deep rooted issues around in academia.",

The main problem I foresee is that the correct reaction may be different for a bear at night or in fog or in the daytime so generating synthetic data that says you should behave the same in all those scenarios is dangerous. You will end up teaching cars to drive at night in the fog the same as if it is broad daylight with full visibility.",

      "comment": "How can I export a simulation generated by NVIDIA COSMOS—not just as a rendered video, but as an editable world or environment—into a simulation platform like Gazebo or Webots, so that I can place my robot inside it and begin interactive testing? In other words, does COSMOS support exporting simulated environments (with physical properties intact) in a format compatible with these platforms, or does it only provide physics-compliant videos that must be treated as non-interactive visual data for passive training purposes?\n\nedit: Can someone also please explain ISAAC SIM (built on Omniverse) and how does it exactly work and compare with simulators like Gazebo?\nThanks",
