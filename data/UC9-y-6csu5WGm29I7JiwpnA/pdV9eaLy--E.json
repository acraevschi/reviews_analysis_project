Will it ever be able to infer and deduce things from only a few samples? Or do we just keep increasing the model sizes until they become too expensive to train and infer?",

We all need a paycheck right now, and it's mad easy to pay no mind to the deep rooted issues around in academia.",

The main problem I foresee is that the correct reaction may be different for a bear at night or in fog or in the daytime so generating synthetic data that says you should behave the same in all those scenarios is dangerous. You will end up teaching cars to drive at night in the fog the same as if it is broad daylight with full visibility.",

I can see a model being useful if the algorithm is able to do \"What if\" reasoning with it.  \n\nWe need more tools in the algorithm toolbox so we're not trying to hammer a nail in with a screwdriver and when unimpressed with the result, we keep buying more boxes of screwdrivers so we can get the nails in faster.",

            "comment": "Until they have \"3d game\" accelerators. Any type of \"real-world\" model is still just a neural net which is making no \"recurring\" logical. It's weird AI training is invested in billions and billions of hours, kilowatt-hours, dollars, and yet there's no model which has a recursive structure??? Like, neurons do one thing, have persistent back-and-forth, not form a concrete front-to-back computation. Even a 4-function calculator can operate on its last state. Current AI is just a huge grifting experiment right?",

            "comment": "How can I export a simulation generated by NVIDIA COSMOS—not just as a rendered video, but as an editable world or environment—into a simulation platform like Gazebo or Webots, so that I can place my robot inside it and begin interactive testing? In other words, does COSMOS support exporting simulated environments (with physical properties intact) in a format compatible with these platforms, or does it only provide physics-compliant videos that must be treated as non-interactive visual data for passive training purposes?\n\nedit: Can someone also please explain ISAAC SIM (built on Omniverse) and how does it exactly work and compare with simulators like Gazebo?\nThanks",
