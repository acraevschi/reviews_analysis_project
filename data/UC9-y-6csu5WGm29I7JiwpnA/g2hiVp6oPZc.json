It's called Lilly it's public on Github. He is absolutely right about the data structure stuff (the only part of the video I've seen thus far). I'm looking forward to watching the rest of this to kind of hear myself being spoken about indirectly from what the experience of making an editor is actually like. It's very fun, there's a huge range of difficulty of stuff to solve and implement, I really enjoy it.",

I basically reverse engineered (read guessed) and imitated it.  The original editor did have word wrap.  I forgot how I - or whether I did that.  I rewrote the editor just to be able to add some math equations to my paper, not for the public.",

It was a DOS app and was limited to a maximum file of 64k which was plenty back in the day. I didn't use arrays - I manipulated the text as one block of contiguous memory. Not suitable for scaling up but worked really quicky due to it being assembly language. It was called DGEDIT.",

What modern text editors actually do is to the insert into a separate buffer and then at convenient time, insert that buffer back into the insertion point. If the data is organised into blocks, it can be quite efficient.",

It worked much like the BASIC editors in most 80's computers, where you type the line number first, and it would strip off the leading number and space and put both in a tuple and insert that into a sequence, keeping the line numbers in order, and i eventually replaced the sequence with an AVL tree to keep insertion times near constant. Whole program was ~500 lines of Nim.",

            "comment": "Wouldn't be better to allocate new \"array\" for each edit. Essentially each edit object would store at what position the edit start and a what position it ends and an array  the size of the edit. That would amount to a base array for the original text, a series of arrays holding the changes and an array holding all the starts and ends of the edit arrays. You could even use a single array and just append at the end of the array all the changes just with the change locations stored, but in this case you would need to store the index of the start in the text,  the index of the ends in the text, the length of the changed text and the index of the edited text.\nAs a bonus this approach would also work as a rudimentary undo and redo system.\nAlso once we save the file could use the arrays to only change portions of the file or insert sectors in between the file, lessening the load on the file system.\nAm I missing something here?\nAfter all this is just a back of the napkin idea for a text editor data structure.",

A search&replace could really hurt if you're not clever about it (like storing the places to change the file and length of change on a first pass and then apply the changes in reverse order, from end to begin).\nWouldn't it be better to store the file in a balanced tree where leaves store a chunk of text? And a bad fragmentation could be avoided by enforcing a minimum chunk length (like 128 or whatever) when not actively inserting in it.\n\nNow that I read wikipedia, it looks like I'm proposing a variant of the Rope data structure. ^^\nExcept i was more thinking of a (threaded) B-Tree rather than a binary tree. And with mutable variable-length smaller strings.\nMakes a simpler and easier to manipulate tree. But recursive undo would require keeping an explicit copy of removed data.",

            "comment": "before you gave the answer of this gap buffer which was new to me, \ni was thinking\nif you have a string struct which has a pointer to the first character, and a length\nand then you store the text as a doubly linked list of these strings\nwhen you first open the file, the entire file could be 1 string, or maybe you have some predefined logic for splitting them eg 1 per line\nif someone wants to edit in the middle of a string, you split that string into 2 (doesnt actually require moving any of the underlying data around in memory, just updating pointers and lengths) \nthen add another entry to the list which points to a newly allocated block of memory between those 2\n\nthis is based on my very simple understanding of how filesystems often handle writing files to disk, but i dont see why it wouldnt work in memory too",

How can you manage lines that can be any length ?  You are being careful in taking under consideration a lot of details (rightly so) and thank you for that.  I guess that your video's purpose is to teach new tricks to people who program but probably did not study computer science at university.  Now how would this audience be able to remove the maximum line constraint ?  Thanks for a great video.  Your thinking is inspiring.",

Also 17 bytes would likely be rounded to 24 or 32 bytes.\n\nLine wrapping actually is now standard in pure text files. In the era of 80 column displays it was common to end each line with a LF or CRLF depeding on the system. How with windowing systems the window on which the text is shown can be arbitrarily wide or narrow so it is not possible to format the text to the window width so it is better to let the editor wrap the lines and put a line break only at the end of the paragraph.\n\nThis of course doe snot apply to source codes where one should turn the word wrap off.",

An other addition could be splitting your document in blocks (pages / chapters / paragraphs, what works best).  Blocks could be stored in separate heap allocations; if a block needs to grow, the copy will be relatively cheap.  If blocks are not too large, you might not even need to copy around a lot, since you can insert blocks (heap allocations) at will, and use the left over space as the local gap buffer.",
