1) Check how to differentiate between shorts and full videos.
2) Do topic modelling on different video sentiments
    - What do negative and positive comments talk about
    - How well do topics in the comments overlap with topics of the video
    - Weight strength of contribution from one comment to the topic by its like and reply counts somehow
3) Build metrics of engagements:
    - Comment Rate = comment_count / view_count
    - Like Rate = like_count / view_count
    - Engagement Rate (simple) = (comment_count + like_count) / view_count
4) Build metrics of sentiment and topics and weight them by number of likes and replies 
5) Check if there are good toxicity and humour detection models
