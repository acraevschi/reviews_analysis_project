1) Check how to differentiate between shorts and full videos.
2) Do topic modelling on different video sentiments
    - What do negative and positive comments talk about
    - How well do topics in the comments overlap with topics of the video
    - Weight strength of contribution from one comment to the topic by its like and reply counts somehow
3) Build a metric of engagement from number of comments (ratio to views), likes (ratio to views) and smth else?
4) Somehow use embeddings to try to predict the number of likes or views
5) Check if there are good toxicity and humour detection models
