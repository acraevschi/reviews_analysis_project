1) Check how to differentiate between shorts and full videos.
2) Do topic modelling on different video sentiments
    - What do negative and positive comments talk about
    - How well do topics in the comments overlap with topics of the video
    - Weight strength of contribution from one comment to the topic by its like and reply counts somehow
3) Build metrics of sentiment and topics and weight them by number of likes and replies 
4) Analyze the sentiment and topics of comments and see if those correlate with engagement metrics for the video 
5) Check if there are good toxicity and humour detection models
